Hey, y’all. Today, I have the 2019 unsolved murder of Liz Barraza. I know it can be frustrating to discuss cases like this when there are still no answers or closure for the victim’s family and friends, but I truly believe that by keeping their names and stories in the public conversation, we can help bring attention to these cases and possibly even spark new leads that could help solve them.

For some reason, Liz’s case has really stuck with me since I first heard about it. Maybe it’s because we were the same age, or because we shared some of the same interests in “nerd stuff”, but I feel a deep connection to her story and a desperate hope that one day justice will be served for her. Let’s get into the cold-blooded murder of Liz Barraza.

About Liz Barraza

Liz Barraza
Elizabeth Barraza was born Elizabeth Marie Nuelle in 1989 in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, to parents Bob and Rosemary. But the family moved to Texas, where Liz spent most of her life.

Liz was my type of people. She was an uber-geek. She was obsessed with Star Wars and Harry Potter. As you can probably imagine, she also enjoyed sci-fi and comics, and eventually, she grew that love into a passion for cosplay and costume-making.

She often participated in Comic-Con, which is a convention of fans of mostly comic books but also all things that are nerdy. And it was at a Comic-Con that Liz met her future husband Sergio Barraza. The couple shared similar interests and passions like Star Wars. Their shared passions brought them closer together, and it wasn’t long before they realized that they had found their soulmate in each other.

Liz and Sergio adopted a dachshund named Diesel and it’s the cutest dog. They were married on February 1, 2014. And according to friends and family, Sergio and Liz were over the moon for each other and had a happy life.

The couple purchased a home in Tomball, Texas, in 2016. It was a dream come true for them – the perfect place to build a life together.

Liz worked as a data reporter at a company called the Rosen Group while Sergio worked for his dad installing flooring.

Liz and Sergio’s passion for cosplay led them to join the 501st Legion, a group of Star Wars enthusiasts who dress up as iconic villains from the franchise. But the organization is much more than just a cosplay group. They are also dedicated to using their love for Star Wars to make a positive impact in their communities.

One of the ways that Liz and Sergio embraced the 501st Legion’s mission was through their involvement in fundraising and community service initiatives. They understood the power that their love for Star Wars had to bring people together and to make a difference in the lives of those around them.

For Liz, one of the most rewarding aspects of being a part of the 501st Legion was the opportunity to visit hospitals in costume and brighten up the day of children who were going through difficult times. She had a special connection with Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas, where she frequently visited in full cosplay attire.

Liz’s kindness and generosity were evident in her desire to bring joy and excitement to the children she met. She understood that a simple act of kindness like a visit from a Star Wars villain could go a long way in brightening up a child’s day and lifting their spirits.

The murder
Back in January 2019, Liz and Sergio had something exciting to look forward to – a trip to Orlando, Florida, to visit Universal Studios. They were especially eager to explore the Harry Potter World section of the park, which had been a dream destination for both of them for a long time.

To make sure they had enough extra money to fully enjoy their trip, Liz came up with the idea of having a garage sale before they left. It was a smart move – after all, everyone knows how expensive theme park trips can be, and Liz wanted to make sure they had plenty of cash to splurge on souvenirs and snacks.

We have reached the beginning of the events leading up to Liz’s death. Most of this information can be confirmed by the Barrazas’ security cameras and footage from a neighbor’s surveillance footage.

On the night of January 24, 2019, Liz decided to hold the garage sale over the next two days: Friday, January 25, and Saturday, January 26.

But what makes Liz’s decision even more significant is the fact that she didn’t have time to advertise the garage sale. Only her family and friends were aware of it, and so it was a small, intimate affair. Perhaps she didn’t want to go through the hassle of creating signs or posting about it on social media. Or maybe she simply wanted to keep it low-key and personal.

Unbeknownst to Liz and Sergio, a black Nissan Frontier drove by their home at 2:00 a.m. the morning of the garage sale. The truck was also spotted at 6:47 a.m. at a nearby school and then on another nearby street.

Liz went to Starbucks to grab a coffee before setting things up for the sale. When Liz returned home around 6:00 a.m., she got right to work setting up for the sale. Meanwhile, Sergio left for work in his white van at 6:48 a.m., just moments before the Nissan Frontier would make another appearance.

The surveillance footage shows the truck driving past the Barraza home at 6:51 a.m., just three minutes after Sergio left. What happened next is truly chilling. The truck either did a three-point turn or made a U-turn and parked behind Liz’s car on the street.

Just a minute later, someone exited the Frontier and approached Liz in the driveway of her home. The person was dressed in what looked like a white robe or a long white dress, with long hair and appearing shorter than Liz, who is only 5’2″.


Liz greeted the person with a, “Good morning,” which sounds like she didn’t know the person. Despite their eight-second conversation, we’ll never know what was said between them. However, what we do know is that Liz’s life was senselessly taken from her in a brutal attack.

The perpetrator shot Liz three times in the chest at point-blank range, obviously with the intention to kill Liz in the early morning hours. Even after she fell to the ground, helpless and wounded, the killer callously shot her again. It’s hard to fathom the level of cold-bloodedness and violence that was displayed in that moment.

As the shooter fled the scene in their truck, Liz’s neighbors were left stunned and horrified. One neighbor heard the gunshots and immediately called 911, while another witnessed the attack on their home security footage. With so many eyewitnesses and pieces of evidence, it’s insane that this case remains unsolved.

The black truck returned to the scene of the crime at 6:55 a.m. The truck was caught on doorbell camera driving by the Barraza home. The police were on the scene only three minutes after the last sighting of the truck.

When first responders arrived at the scene, Liz was miraculously still alive and she was rushed to Memorial Hermann Hospital, the same hospital where she had volunteered to encourage and uplift sick children. Sadly, Liz passed away after being hospitalized for several hours.

The investigation
Below is a video of the incident. The footage captures the moment when Liz was shot, so if you’re someone who would be sensitive to that kind of content, I would advise you to skip it.


The Harris County Sherriff’s Department immediately cordoned off the crime scene and began questioning Sergio, as well as the couple’s friends and family, hoping to find any lead that could help them unravel the mystery. But none of the evidence clearly pointed to any motive or suspect.

There were no shell casings at the scene, leading investigators to conclude that the murder weapon was a revolver. That’s unfortunate for the investigation because a lack of shell casings leaves virtually no forensic evidence to work with.

To add to the mystery, there are rumors circulating that the shooter may have handed Liz something before pulling the trigger. Some speculate that it could have been a note or some other type of communication, but the police have not confirmed this theory.

Despite the lack of physical evidence, the police were able to gather crucial information from the video footage retrieved from the neighborhood’s security systems. With the footage, they were able to piece together a timeline of the killer’s movements and identify the truck used in the crime – a 2013 or newer Nissan Frontier Pro-4X.

Investigators also were able to make out the killer’s appearance, even if none of the footage had a clear shot of the shooter’s face. Early on in the investigation, the police had a hunch that the shooter might be a woman based on their size and gait, but that was just speculation at that point.

What caught my attention, however, was the fact that Liz and Sergio were both heavily involved in the Star Wars cosplay community. As a fellow fan, I couldn’t help but wonder if the killer might have been someone dressed up in Princess Leia cosplay. The dress seen in the footage certainly looked like something Leia would wear, and it’s not outside the realm of possibility that someone might have used their cosplay outfit as a cover for their nefarious actions.

Also notable in the surveillance videos is that the killer appears to get in and out of the truck on the driver’s side. Meaning they likely acted alone.

In August 2019, only a few months after Liz’s murder, the media reported that police were waiting on the results from a warrant that would be instrumental in solving the case. But so far, we don’t know anything else about the warrant. Some speculate that it could be related to traffic cams or cell phone data, but we really don’t know.

And that’s all that we know. If the police have more evidence, they aren’t telling us.

Theories

Most of the theories floating around the internet about Liz’s murder revolve around Liz’s husband Sergio. I should note here that there is no actual evidence to indicate that Liz and Sergio had problems in their relationship or that Sergio was involved.

Many of these theories paint Sergio as the prime suspect in her death, despite the lack of evidence pointing in that direction. It’s important to note that there’s no indication that Liz and Sergio had any issues in their relationship, and Sergio has been fully cooperative with authorities since the investigation began.

But Sergio remarried less than two years after Liz’s death, so some people believe that shows that he wanted to get rid of Liz so that he could marry someone else. I don’t buy this as evidence at all. Maybe it’s not the best look, but I can’t tell someone how to grieve.

Case status

The case is still very much active and her family is still desperately seeking the truth. There is currently a $50,000.00 reward for information leading to an arrest in the case.

Final thoughts

As someone who follows true crime cases closely, I can’t help but feel a sense of hope when it comes to the investigation into Liz Barraza’s murder. With the abundance of video evidence that was captured around the time of her death, it feels like this is a case that can and should be solved.

Who do I think killed Liz Barraza? My instinct says it’s someone who knew Liz or was in the Star Wars community, but that could be totally off base. But at this point, any speculation is just that – speculation.
