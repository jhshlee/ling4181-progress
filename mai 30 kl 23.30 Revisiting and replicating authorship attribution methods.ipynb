    "## Introduction\n",
    "Authorship attribution is an age old problem that relates to the study of (writing) style where style is a unique variety of language use in an individual. (Crystal, 2008) The previous sentence implies that there is a unique set of stylistic markers that an author habitually or unconsciously employs in their writing, and that style is something that can be attributed back to an individual. In real-life applications, however, it is hard to simply say that, since multiple questions are usually intertwined to form one problem: for example, how many candidates are there, how long are the documents in question, and how old are they? <br>\n",
    "Two famous authorship attribution cases show the variability of questions in application: Shakespeare’s authorship problem and the Unabomber case. The two cases show a similarity in that there are multiple lengthy documents to assign, but they are different in that the primary objective of the former is to verify whether the documents share the same author, or whether the proposed candidate (William Shakespeare, or someone else) is the correct author, while that for the latter is finding a certain individual(s) that is likely to have written the document, among an open pool of candidates. What features we consider more important than others can drastically change the approach to the solution, too. Are some features more reflective of the author than others? Is it realistically possible to assign a correct author to an unattributed text with them?<br>\n",
    "With this essay, I aim to attempt to answer such questions, tying together the readings to get an overview of the matter at hand and reporting the procedures and results from my own experiments based on the methods mentioned in the readings. In the grand scheme of things, the semester was divided into two parts that virtually progressed at the same time: first, finding and reading previous studies, and second, replicating methods from the readings, including learning to code in Python and collecting data to test them on. <br>\n",
    "There were clear limitations to this endeavor: to name a few, I could not verify the reliability of each method using valid statistical methods due to lack of time, and I did not replicate methods employing machine learning techniques. Discussions and reflections on the procedures will follow in more detail in the final section. Still, the semester as well as the replication attempts were a good opportunity to investigate a topic, which could potentially lead to more in-depth studies in the future: I plan to continue the research, as this small project left more questions than there were before.<br>\n",
    "The report is structured as the following: I first piece together several previous studies related to the topic and explain central issues of authorship. Then I explain the methods I replicated in more detail with actual codes I used. Finally, I present the results and evaluate the successfulness and limitations of the project.<br>\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "### Problems and paradigms in stylometry\n",
    "Authorship attribution, in the sense it has in the present essay, is a quantitative approach to the study of stylistics, and the goal of authorship attribution is to assign correct author(s) to the unattributed text. In automated authorship attribution tasks, “text” refers to written documents and this does not include texts produced and conveyed using other media such as pictures, audio, or video. Stylistics could be understood as an intersection of literary analysis and linguistics, but it is widely applicable in a variety of other contexts as well, such as historical/religious studies, authorship credits/plagiarism-related controversies, political discourse analysis, and criminal investigations (including online attacks and feuds).<br>\n",
    "Different situations call for different approaches, as Koppel et al. (2013) classify typical attribution problems like the following (the names in parentheses are taken from Koppel et al. (2013, p. 318)):<br>\n",
    "1. Problems where the goal is to find a most likely author among a closed set of candidate authors and an abundance of sample text is available (“simple authorship attribution”),\n",
    "2. problems where the goal is to identify if two long texts are written by the same author (“long-text verification”): in other words, it is a binary question, and\n",
    "3. problems where the goal is to attribute a text to one author among a large set of candidates (“many-candidates problem”).<br>\n",
    "In addition to this, there are problems where there are very many candidates among which we do not even know if the true author is included, or the candidates’ samples or the unattributed texts are too short for comparison. Koppel et al. poses “the fundamental problem” which is a problem of determining whether two (shorter) texts were written by the same person or two different authors. \n",
    "There are two main paradigms in authorship attribution that is considered, which can (and should) be modified depending on the type of task at hand: similarity-based approach on one hand and machine-learning methods on the other. A similarity-based method relies on the similarity between the query text (the anonymous text to be attributed) and a known author’s style profile – all available writing by that author is considered like a single document. “Similarity” can be defined in a variety of ways. A machine-learning method use writings of a candidate author as training data to construct a classifier that categorizes anonymous documents. (Koppel et al., 2013; Koppel et al., 2012; Koppel & Winter, 2014)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stylistic features\n",
    "Which linguistic features represent the individual writing better than others is the central question in authorship attribution, especially in similarity-based methods. Here, I introduce two concepts proposed in previous studies with varying reliability: the methods I replicate are presented in more detail in the next section.<br>\n",
    "CUSUM method (Morton, 1991; Morton and Michaelson, 1990), which is short for cumulative sum analysis, considers the occurrence of several variables within a sentence, such as the words starting with a vowel or words that are two or three letters long. The cumulative sum of to what degree these measurements as well as the sentence length deviate from the average of the whole text is calculated and compared to known author profiles that are calculated the same way. The assumption that forms the basis of this method is that language habits are constant, and the two profiles would match each other if the same author wrote both. (Coulthard et al., 2017) This method was accepted in court multiple times from 1991, before its reliability and the validity of its assumptions were refuted (Hardcastle, 1993, 1997; Totty et al., 1987). <br>\n",
    "Zipf’s law (1932) provide us with useful insights about the pattern of how word-types in a (natural language) text are distributed. Zipf found that when we rank all word-types in order of frequency, the frequency of the type at ith rank is inversely proportional of the rank. Put differently, the frequency of the most common word is about twice as much as the second most common word. From this, we can predict that a few word-types cover a majority of tokens in a corpus: just 150 most frequent word-types account for 50-65% of a text. (Savoy, 2020)<br>\n",
    "This inspires using word frequency as an important variable in characterizing a certain individual’s language habit. Various measurement methods were since proposed with relation to word frequency, each with a different view on what words are more meaningful to measure frequency of: type-token ratio is a classic index; Burrows (2002) takes the most frequent word-types, Labbé (2007) considers all word-types, and so on.<br>\n",
    "Several non-linguistic aspects influence one’s writing style, including gender, period in which the text is written, age, and genre. In what form these aspects are reflected in statistically measurable linguistic features, and to what extent those linguistic features are chosen consciously, and therefore to what extent these stylistic preferences reflect cognitive processes or social backgrounds, are all unclear. The endeavor to find answers to these questions might cross the boundaries of stylistics.<br>\n"

    "In this section, I explain in detail the data collection procedure and methods of analysis. As was mentioned in the previous section, there are various types of tasks in authorship attribution: simple closed-set problem, verification problems with a binary question, many-candidates problems are the common types of stylometry tasks. In real-world authorship attribution problems, however, there are also instances of co-authorship, which requires more complex methods of analysis which will not dealt with in the present paper. <br>\n",
    "The methods employed in the replications illustrated in this section are applicable for closed-set, single-author problems, and the data were collected accordingly. The methods can be divided to two large sections: lexical analysis and distance-based analysis. I collected data and wrote the codes myself, but the formula for each quantitative analysis largely followed chapters 2 and 3 from Savoy(2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data collection\n",
    "Two sets of data consisted with texts from three authors each were collected. I call them `data1` and `data2` respectively.\n",
    "As the writing style of an individual varies across themes (what the text is about) and channels (what platform the text was intended for), I decided one channel and two themes: about gardening and true crime, on blogs run by private individuals. Sample blogs are found by several simple google search sessions using keywords \"gardening\" and \"true crime\". Three random blogs each with enough amount of text were selected. In total, texts from 3 gardening-related blogs were included in the first dataset (`data1`), and three true-crime blogs were included in the other (`data2`). Texts were manually collected going from reverse chronological order. A short excerpt from each author were stored separately as test(query) text. The query text is not included in the sample text. (In this essay, \"text\" refer to each sample text whose author is the same, unless otherwise noted.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Things worth noting about texts and collecting them:\n",
    "1. I do not personally know any of the blog owners that were included in the sample. (Links to the source blogs are included in the bibliography.)\n",
    "2. Author C in data1 was one of three co-writers in the blog, so I filtered out the two other authors and only included one.\n",
    "3. Some manual processing was involved to delete links, advertisement, mentions of the names of the blog owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blog posts as a text\n",
    "I use blog posts as sample texts for the experiment. Blogs, like other channels, show several characteristic features which should be considered when analyzed:\n",
    "1. Blogs are online platforms for individuals or groups of people to share thoughts, experiences, or knowledge on various topics. Blog posts are typically reverse-chronologically organized, though there is no set rule for organizing posts.\n",
    "2. There is no set rules for the type of content, formality or layout for blog posts. Therefore, blog writers have a flexibility of writing styles. Some blogs deal with a single topic seriously, while others have different purposes.\n",
    "3. Many different types of media including images, audio files, and videos can be incorporated into the posts. These can be embedded inside the posts so that the readers can directly check them out without leaving the page, or provided as hyperlinks to external websites. This implies that a lot can be explained without using written words, and there can be mixed-medium contexts where the context cannot be understood entirely if only the text is considered.\n",
    "4. It is a platform for relatively casual writings, and thus blog posts include words and phrases characteristic of casual online texts. At the same time, blogs are usually for long-form contents: language use characteristic of short-form text platforms such as YouTube comment sections and Twitter is rarely present in blog posts. It is difficult to generalize linguistic features specific for blog posts since there is a great variety of forms and themes across blogs, but the blogs included in the sample tended to be casual and long-form.\n",
    "\n",
    "I presumed that inter-genre variability within a single individual would be bigger than interpersonal variability within a single genre, but blogs might be a different story. Blogs operate under self-determined rules, which might lead us to predict that there can be more room for variability between blogs than, say, tweets.\n",

It is then possible to calculate how many items(words) there are inside each item(sentence), and calculating mean sentence length is as simple as dividing the sum of sentence lengths by the length of the text(number of sentences)."
