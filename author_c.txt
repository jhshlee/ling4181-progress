Fall gardens produce vegetable and flower plants that fully mature in the fall before the cold weather sets in. Planning a fall garden involves planting late-season seeds in the summer, 14 weeks before fall, which will grow into mature crops that produce throughout fall and winter.

There are plenty of vegetables to plant for a fall garden. These plants include tender annuals, like corn and tomatoes, and hardy annuals, like broccoli and lettuce

What to Grow for a Fall Garden
What to Grow for a Fall Garden

Hardy and tender annuals grow well in a fall garden. Cold hardy vegetables  — like peas, lettuce, and broccoli — are resistant to colder weather, making these plants the most successful for a fall garden. Tender annuals — like tomatoes, corn, bush beans, cucumbers, pumpkin, and summer squashes — are usually harvested in summer but can extend into the fall if seeds are planted in batches. The last batch needs to be harvested before the frost and cold harsh weather.

Other annual plants that are typically planted for fall gardens include:

Brassicas
Brussel sprouts
Cabbage
Cauliflower
Greens
Kale
Spinach
Collards
Arugula
Mustard greens
Root vegetables
Beets
Carrots
Radishes
Sweet potatoes
Celery
Turnips
Leeks
Other vegetables
Green onions
Herbs
Parsley
Cilantro
Flowers
Pansies
Mums
Larkspur
Mistflower
Choose seeds that will mature before the frost sets in. The time it takes for a seed to fully develop into a mature plant is shown on the seed’s package. Carrots, celery, onions, and beets are best suited to moderate climates that don’t experience harsh, cold weather during the fall.

Preparing for a Fall Garden


There are a few key steps to preparing a fall garden to ensure that the annual plants are mature enough to thrive in the cold:

Look up the average date for the first and last frost dates for your zip code, and choose seeds that reach maturity within the time until that date
Start hardy annual seeds, with slow root development, indoors 12 to 14 weeks before the first frost
Prepare the soil in an outdoor garden bed, while indoor seeds develop, by adding nutrients such as worm castings and compost
Prepare tender annual seeds, with quick root development, by soaking them in a bowl of water in the fridge for one night before direct planting to speed up their germination
Transfer indoor seedlings to outdoor garden beds after three weeks. At the same time, plant the tender annual seeds into the garden beds. Make sure to push seeds deeply into the beds where the cooler soil will promote germination
Add mulch around each plant as it grows to keep the ground cool. Straw and grass clippings make good homemade mulch
Cover plants during warm days with floating row covers to prevent worms from ruining the new plants. Use shade coverings during the hot, late summer and early fall days
Timeline for Planting a Fall Garden
Timeline for Planting a Fall Garden

After calculating the frost date for your area, prepare the fall garden based on this timeline:

12 to 14 weeks before the first frost — Sow tender annual plant seeds directly into outdoor garden beds. Sow hardy annual plant seeds indoors
10 to 12 weeks before the first frost — Transfer indoor seedlings into the outdoor garden bed(s), and sow hardy seeds like collards, carrots, beets, scallions, leeks, radishes and lettuce directly into the outdoor garden beds
8 to 10 weeks before the first frost — Sow seeds like turnips, mustard greens, Asian greens, spinach, and arugula directly into outdoor garden beds. Add more lettuce and radish seeds to the garden to enjoy a staggered harvest leading up to the frost date
6 to 8 weeks before the first frost — Sow the final batches of lettuce and spinach. Add a protective frame over the last batches to protect these plants from the cold
Advantages of Planning Ahead for a Fall Garden
Advantages of Planning Ahead

Planning for a fall garden over the summer gives you enough time to prepare the soil for the new seeds. Planning also helps gardeners plant seeds early enough for the plants to mature fully before the cold weather begins.

A well-prepared fall garden results in successful crops that are matured in time to be enjoyed when fall and winter arrive. This avoids frost and harsh weather ruining the crops and leaving a small fall harvest or no fall harvest at all.

Cool fall weather acts as a refrigerator that keeps mature plants healthy for longer. However, if the plants haven’t matured in time, they won’t survive in a fall garden.

Fall Garden Layout Ideas and Inspiration
Fall Garden Layout

Try these garden layout ideas to plan a fall garden and adjust as needed for the plants you have chosen to grow.


Fall Garden Layout: Three-Bed Complementary Plants
In three or more raised or buried beds, that are at least 3 feet deep, space fall garden plants according to the instructions on the seed packages.


Plant up to two varieties of plants in each bed using vegetables that complement each other structurally. For example, plant one bed with three tomato plants in the middle of a bed, surrounded by bean bushes in the remaining spaces. Peas and carrots also grow well together, as do cucumbers and spinach.

In a second bed, plant vegetables that complement each other’s harvest times. Because lettuce and corn are planted at different stages, plant these plants together in their own bed.

In a third bed, add plants that complement each other visually. Plant a mix of herbs and fall flowers to add color to the garden.


Fall Garden Layout: One-Bed Complementary Plants
One garden bed can hold many plants to make harvesting easy. Using one garden bed that’s roughly 6 feet wide and 8 feet long, space companion plants according to the package instructions. This method will create a colorful fall garden.

Place companion plants close together to keep plants healthy and thriving. For example, combine late-producing plants, such as tomatoes and bell peppers, in one row.

Grow climbing peas around circular tomato cages in another row. Plant spinach, carrots, bush green beans, and broccoli interspersed in an additional row and complete the last row with mixed herbs.


The mix of colors and varieties of plants in one garden bed makes for a colorful, easy garden that is perfect for small spaces.

Tips and Expert Advice for Fall Gardens
Keep these extra tips in mind when planning a fall garden:

Harvest brassicas, greens, and root vegetables in the fall — these plants taste best when grown in cold months
Start with a small vegetable garden when planting a fall garden for the first time. Plant a few batches of one root vegetable and one green and then add more vegetables for the next fall garden
Rotate crops to reduce the chance of pests and diseases, that may have affected the previous crop, from reinfecting the new crop. Clear away all the debris, roots, leaves, and weeds from the previous crop before planting new ones
Don’t use frost covers during the hotter months because the covers will overheat and kill the seeds. Instead, use shade cloths to shield the fall seeds during hot weather
Harvest summer and spring crops on time to make room in the garden beds for the fall plants

The blue star juniper is an attractive plant that’s easy to grow and care for. If you have this popular plant in your garden, it’s good to know about suitable companion plants to grow alongside or in front of your blue star juniper.


What Is a Blue Star Juniper?
The juniperus squamata blue star juniper is a slow-growing, small shrub. This drought-resistant evergreen plant is dome-shaped, with needle-like leaves in a variety of colors, ranging from blue to silver to lilac.

Blue star juniper shrubs work well as groundcovers when paired with companion plants that blend in well with the blue star juniper.


The Best Blue Star Juniper Companion Plants
Many different ground cover plants pair well with blue star junipers, balancing, contrasting, or highlighting the striking coloring and enhancing the natural beauty of the juniper.

Companion Plants With Blue Foliage
Many plants have leaves or flowers in different shades of blue, making them good companion plants for the blue star juniper. Placing shrubs of similar colors close together is aesthetically pleasing because the colors tend to blend in, creating a tranquil effect. 

These plants, available from your local garden center, make the best companion plants for blue star junipers.

The yucca, originating in the southwestern United States, is a perennial shrub with long, pointed leaves. Available in a variety of species, the yucca is another good blue star juniper companion plant.

The evergreen yucca is a shrub that does well in many different climates, and can survive in temperatures as low as 10°F. However, this plant needs well-draining soil and should be planted in full sun. 

Some species of yucca can grow as tall as 3 feet, and they need enough space to reach their full growth potential. The pointed leaves are needle-sharp, so take care to avoid injury.

Agave
The agave is a drought resistant succulent plant with long, spiky-rimmed leaves that grow in a rosette formation. Native to North America, this perennial plant needs little water and thrives in arid areas. 

The century plant, or Agave Americana, is a species of agave that does well in a variety of growing conditions. This plant is easily identified by its unusual white stripe and is popular for its strikingly beautiful flowers. 

Agaves need full sunlight and can be planted directly on the ground, in well-draining sandy soil.

Silver Mound
The silver mound, also known as the sea form artemisia, is a suitable companion plant for the blue star juniper. Native to Japan, this perennial, with its fine, silver-blue leaves, is ideally suited to warmer climates.

Plant silver mounds as blue star juniper companion plants in a herb garden or rock garden, where these evergreens are excellent as edging or ground cover. Full sun ensures healthy growth with abundant silver foliage.

The low maintenance silver mound is drought-tolerant and does well in dry, mildly fertile soil with good drainage.

Cut off the small yellow flowers of the silver mound regularly so that they don’t inhibit foliage growth.

Veronica
The Veronica, also often called the speedwell, is a perennial plant that comes in a variety of colors such as purple, blue, or pink, and is easy to cultivate. The flowers, with their long, pointed petals, last a long time, adding vibrant color to your beds.

Veronicas are hardy plants that easily tolerate arid conditions, but need regular watering during the driest months of summer.

Plant the speedwell in a warm spot with full sun to partial shade. This plant is not fussy about soil conditions and does well in a wide range of soil pH levels.

Partridge Feather
Partridge feather is an attractive groundcover that complements the blue star juniper and makes an excellent companion plant. Although this mound-shaped small shrub has yellow flowers, the silver-blue, feathery leaves make the partridge feather one of the best companion plants for the blue star juniper.

The leaves of the partridge feather have an interesting texture, with a soft, velvety feel.


Standing about 3-5 inches tall and with a width of 15-24 inches, the fully grown partridge feather offers a colorful contrast to the blue star juniper. Most gardeners enjoy being able to choose whichever companion plants to cultivate as blue star juniper companion plants, according to their personal preferences.

Plant the partridge feather in full sun to partial shade, in soil with good drainage. Overly wet conditions cause damage to the roots, eventually causing root rot. These plants are ideally suited to rocky gardens.

Silver Bush
The silver bush, also known by its other name, the cushion bush, originated in Southern Australia. This plant is popular for its beautiful foliage. The stems and leaves are a shimmering silver color, glistening and sparkling in sunlight.


With its small, bright yellow flowers, the cushion bush contrasts beautifully with the blue star juniper, making these two plants perfect companions. They have the same characteristics as far as light and water requirements are concerned.

Both the cushion bush and the blue star juniper do well in dry conditions and don’t need much specialized attention. The cushion bush doesn’t have a long life span, and individual specimens need to be replaced regularly.

Dusty Miller

Other Blue Colored Plants
There are many other species of plants that bloom with blue or lilac colored flowers and make good blue star juniper companion plants. The varying shades of blue and lilac complement each other, enhancing the beauty of each plant.

There are very few rules about what can or can’t be planted as a companion plant. Choose whichever plants work best in your garden. Here are a few suggestions of blue-flowered plants to plant alongside the blue star juniper in both small gardens and larger spaces. 

Hydrangea
The hydrangea, also known as the hortensia, is a colorful bush that loves full sun in the morning and partial shade in the afternoon. The color of the hydrangea’s blooms varies according to the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, but the most common colors are varying shades of blue and purple. 

With its large blue or purple heads and long flowering season, the hydrangea is a perfect companion plant for the blue star juniper. Water hydrangeas regularly to prevent the leaves from wilting. 

Hydrangeas make excellent flowers for putting in vases, and cutting off the heads encourages new growth. Cut hydrangeas back every year at the end of the flowering season, to ensure prolific blooms the following year.

Iris
The iris is a well-loved plant with over 200 different varieties. Named after Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow, this plant comes in numerous striking colors, such as yellow, white, and varying shades of blue, lilac and purple. The blue-toned varieties of iris work well as a companion to the blue star juniper.

Irises are among the early blooming perennials and are easy to grow. These plants enjoy heat and will thrive in full sun to partial shade. They are hardy plants and grow well in most U.S. gardening zones.

Because irises multiply rapidly, they should be separated every 2-3 years to prevent overcrowding. Separating irises will ensure that the plants last for many years.

Agapanthus
The agapanthus, commonly known as the lily of the nile, is a long stemmed purple flower with a large head. 

The deep purple color makes the agapanthus a great blue star juniper companion plant, because their colors are so similar. Agapanthus plants are tall, making them an ideal backdrop for blue star junipers in flower beds.

Blooming from the beginning of spring to the end of summer, the Agapanthus is easy to grow and does well in full sun to partial shade. This plant needs a lot of water in the summer months to prevent it becoming dehydrated.

The best time for planting lily of the nile is in spring, to give the plant time to take root and become established before the winter cold settles in.


Cornflower

The cornflower, sometimes affectionately known as the bachelor’s button, is an annual flowering plant originally found in many parts of Europe. Because the cornflower grows, so freely and easily, it was considered to be a weed in certain areas where it would invade cornfields, giving the plant the name cornflower.

Cornflowers are easy to maintain, but must be pulled out and discarded at the end of the flowering season. Replant every year for a breathtaking show of small blue flowers throughout the summer.


Cornflowers do well as a companion for the blue star juniper because both plants have similar coloring. Sprinkle cornflower seeds among your blue star juniper for a lush mingling of two stunning blue flowers.

Wisteria
The wisteria plant grows in vines, with large clusters of hanging blooms in a striking show of lilac and purple. Wisteria makes the perfect blue star juniper companion plant, with the purple of the wisteria flowers accentuating and complementing the blue of the juniper.

Wisterias grow easily and rapidly, and need to be tamed and guided along a support structure to prevent the plant from spreading uncontrollably. Thread the wisteria tendrils through a trellis or garden fence to encourage steady growth. The resulting hedge offers a wonderful background for the blue star juniper.


Plant Wisterias between April and October for the most prolific results. Take care with wisteria if you have animals. After the wisteria flowers die off, this plant produces pods that are toxic. These pods are highly dangerous when eaten by dogs or cats.

In Conclusion
Planting the blue star juniper together with companion plants creates an eye-catching display that gives your garden a striking appearance. There are many blue star juniper companion plants that can enhance the look of your flower beds. Choose from a broad selection of suitable plants to act as a leafy friend to your blue star juniper.

Garden compost is plant food made from decomposed organic material such as dead leaves, grass clippings, kitchen waste from fruit and vegetables, and discarded paper and cardboard, among other things.


Using compost in the garden helps to minimize soil erosion, and enriches the soil by adding essential nutrients such as fungi and bacteria, which are needed for healthy plant growth. Ground cover plants like the Japanese forest grass also helps with soil erosion.

Composting is an environmentally friendly way of using waste materials. Recycling kitchen leftovers and scraps, and excess paper materials cuts down on household waste and reduces the need for landfills.


Understanding the Composting Process
Gardening With Compost

The composting process requires four crucial elements:

Brown and green organic matter: Organic matter consists of plants and animal manures. Brown organic matter is made up of dead leaves, twigs, dead plants, and manure. Green organic matter is made up of grass cuttings, rotten fruit and vegetables, and fruit and vegetable peels.


A mixture of brown and green organic material, in a ratio of 1:1, should be used to make compost. Brown organic matter provides carbon, and green organic matter provides nitrogen for the soil, both essential gasses in the composting process.


Oxygen: The organic material should be cut or shredded into small pieces to increase the material’s surface area, thus allowing oxygen to circulate more easily. During the composting process, heat builds up in the center of the pile of material. Oxygen is necessary to help raise the temperature, which speeds up the composting process.

Moisture: The composting process requires a certain amount of moisture for decomposition to occur. The composting material should be kept damp, but not sodden.

Bacteria: Bacteria cause organic matter to decompose. In the right conditions, bacteria grow naturally and are an essential component of the composting process.

The composting process takes between one and three months, depending on the size of the pile and how often it is turned.

What Can You Compost?
Fruit and vegetable waste
Eggshells
Shredded paper and old newspapers

Cardboard
Teabags
Coffee filters and coffee grounds
Nuts and nutshells
Leaves
Lawn cuttings
Plants
Garden trimmings and offcuts
Wood chips and offcuts
Sawdust
Straw and hay
Wool and cotton items
Ashes
Animal fur and human hair
Kitchen waste should be stored in a plastic bag in the fridge and garden material should be stored in a pile under a tarp, or in a sheltered spot, until you are ready to add it to the compost pile.

What Shouldn’t You Add to Your Compost Pile?
The following items shouldn’t be added to your compost pile because these items rot and make the compost smell bad. When organic matter decomposes, it breaks down into its individual components that provide nutrients for plants. The following items aren’t organic. When they rot, they decay and produce harmful organisms that can destroy healthy plants.

Raw meat or fish
Dairy products
Pet waste
Cooking fats and oils
How to Make Compost (Step-by-Step)
Gardening With Compost

Here is a great recipe for compost:

1 part dry leaves
1 part other brown organic matter, such as dried twigs, pine cones, and pine needles
1 part green lawn trimmings
1 part fruit and vegetable waste
Follow these steps to make compost at home:

1.Choose Where to Make and Store the Compost
Compost can be made in an open pile or in a specially designed compost bin. A bin is neat and clean, keeps pests and animals away from the compost, and efficiently holds in heat which is needed for making compost.

There are many types and styles of compost bins available from gardening stores, or you can make your own bin. We like to use a 3 bin compost system. Base the size of the bin you select on the amount of waste you generate and the amount of compost you wish to produce.

2. Choose Where to Place the Compost Bin or Pile
Choose a sunny spot with good drainage. Your compost bin should be in an easily accessible position that is convenient for you to get to at all times.

3. Add Alternate Layers
Start with a layer of coarse brown organic matter, such as twigs and dried pine cones, to allow air to circulate. Add a layer of soft brown materials, like leaves and pine needles. The top layer should be a mixture of green materials, like food scraps and lawn trimmings.

Continue to add organic matter in layers of brown and green to ensure an adequate supply of carbon and nitrogen.

4. Continue Adding Organic Waste as It Accumulates
Keep a container or a plastic bag in your fridge to store food scraps and fruit and vegetable waste. Empty the container onto the compost pile as soon as the container is full.

Keep a garbage bag in your yard for leaves and garden waste. Empty the bag onto the compost pile when it is full.

5. Caring for Your Compost Bin
Each time you add new organic matter to the compost pile, stir the new material into the compost to mix it in with the lower materials that have already started to decompose. This will aerate the pile and speed up the decomposition of the new material.

Maintain the correct moisture level. The compost should be damp, but not completely wet. Organic material that is too dry doesn’t decompose quickly enough. Material that is too wet rots and starts to smell bad. If the pile is drying out, add only enough water to dampen the material, and mix the pile well after adding the water.

Once the bin is full, stir the compost every two weeks to aerate the material, to speed up the decomposition process, and to prevent bad odors.

Using Compost in Your garden
To tell if the compost is ready, check the color. A dark brown color tells you that the compost is ready to be used. The compost at the top of the bin will be ready first when it is eight–12 weeks old. Use the top half first, and leave the bottom half to continue decomposing.

Compost can be added to your garden during spring, summer, and autumn.

Sprinkle a light layer of compost on the lawn once per season, at any time of the year.

Flower beds, trees, and shrubs need a light layer of compost sprinkled over the soil. Lightly dig the compost into the soil. Compost can be added to vegetable gardens and vegetable patches in the same way.


When planting new flowers or trees, adding compost to the hole before planting gives the new plant added nutrition and boosts growth.

Types of Composting Bins
There are many types of composting bins. The most popular and common bins are:

Basic composter — A basic composter is a bin that is a complete, wooden or plastic unit with a lid. The basic composter is easy to maintain, keeps your compost neat and tidy, and contains odors. The basic composter’s small size makes it an ideal composting bin for small gardens and yards
Spinning composter — A spinning composter is a wooden or plastic unit hung on a raised frame, and has a handle to easily stir the compost. Stirring the compost regularly helps to distribute the heat that builds up in the center of the compost, speeding up the decomposition time. The handle of the spinning composter needs to be turned regularly
Worm composter — A worm composter is an enclosed plastic unit with ventilation and drain holes, and usually raised off the ground. Worms live in the bin and feed off fruit, vegetable scraps and peelings, and other kitchen waste. A worm composter is an environmentally friendly way to deal with kitchen scraps. Since worm composters don’t smell bad, they make good indoor composting units, and are ideal for apartment dwellers with limited space. Just be sure to keep your worm composter clean
Homemade compost bin  — You can make your own compost bin out of wood or wire. Wooden pallets or scrap lumber are perfect for a homemade composting bin. You can construct your bin according to your needs, making it the appropriate size for your available space

Growing spinach indoors is easy to do all year-round. Plant spinach in a container and place it in a cool spot that gets four to six hours of sunlight per day, and you will have healthy spinach six weeks later.

How To Grow Lettuce In Containers
Here’s how to grow spinach indoors:

Place the seeds in water for one day, a week before planting
Remove the seeds from the water after 24 hours and store the seeds in an airtight container in a cool spot for one week
Fill a pot with nutrient-rich soil and plant the seeds ½-inch deep in the soil. Ensure that the pot has sufficient drainage holes at the bottom
Water lightly every three to four days to keep the soil lightly moist
When the seeds start sprouting, add some fertilizer to the soil
Harvest the spinach six weeks later
How to Grow Spinach Indoors (Step-by-Step)
Growing Spinach in a container

You need the following equipment to grow spinach indoors:

A suitable pot or container
A trowel
Good-quality potting soil
Spinach seeds
Spinach thrives in cool conditions with limited sunlight. Select the right spot to grow spinach successfully, and follow these easy steps:

Prepare the Seeds

Prepare the seeds one week before planting by soaking the seeds in a glass of warm water for 24 hours. Moistening the seeds in this way encourages germination once the seeds have been planted.

Remove the seeds from the water after 24 hours and dry them gently with a clean cloth or paper towel. Store the seeds in a sealed container in a cool place for one week.


Choose the Right Pot

Spinach needs a roomy pot. Select a large pot that is at least 8 inches deep and big enough to plant the seeds 3 inches apart. Drainage holes at the bottom are essential to prevent root rot.

Select the Best Position

Spinach does well in a cool spot that gets four to six hours of sunlight per day, with a temperature of 40–75°F. Hotter temperatures or longer exposure to direct sunlight causes the spinach plant to wilt.

If you don’t have a spot with natural light, you can plant spinach indoors with an LED light. Initially the young seedlings need 13–15 hours of light per day, and as the plant matures this can be reduced to eight to 10 hours per day.

Prepare the Soil

Fill the pot with good-quality, loamy potting soil that is rich in nitrogen and organic matter. The soil should be well-aerated to allow for good drainage, and the pH should be neutral.

Plant the Seeds

Place the prepared seeds on the soil, 3 inches apart. Cover the seeds with ½-inch layer of soil. Water lightly to dampen the soil.

Water Regularly

Water the soil lightly every three to four days. Keep the soil lightly moist, but avoid saturating it.
Excessive watering keeps the roots wet and causes root rot. Don’t water the leaves. If the leaves remain wet they can develop mildew, which is a fungal infection. If you find yourself too busy and caught up with everything in your life, you can try self-watering planters to ensure the soil stays lightly moist.

Fertilize

Once the seeds start to sprout, add some fertilizer or manure to the soil to nourish the spinach plant. Follow the instructions on store-bought fertilizer packs.

Watering with manure tea or using liquid fertilizer are good ways to add nutrients to the soil. For best results fertilize again after three weeks.

Mulch

Mulching with organic matter helps to retain moisture and adds nutrients to the soil, encouraging healthy growth.

Place a thin layer of mulch around the base of the spinach plant. Avoid using too much mulch. Over-mulching traps moisture and keeps the roots too wet.

Harvest

Spinach is ready to harvest when the plant has at least six leaves, each of which should be four inches long. Don’t wait for flowers to appear, because the leaves develop a bitter taste once the plant starts to flower.

Cut the individual leaves with clean, sharp scissors. New leaves will soon emerge. Alternatively, cut the entire plant at the base of its stem. The plant will regrow.

Types of Spinach for an Indoor Garden

How to Store Spinach
Remove the stems from the leaves and wash the leaves well. Dry the leaves and place them in an airtight container or zip lock bag.


Place a dampened piece of paper towel on top of the spinach leaves and seal the bag or container. The spinach will keep fresh for up to two weeks in the fridge.

How to Freeze Spinach
Fresh spinach can be frozen and stored in the freezer for up to three months. To freeze raw spinach, place spinach leaves in a blender or food processor with a few drops of water.

Blend the spinach to a smooth paste. Freeze the paste in ice cube trays, and add the frozen spinach to soups, stews, and smoothies.


How to Regrow Spinach
When harvesting spinach, cut the leaves to within 2 inches of the base of the plant, using sharp, clean gardening shears.

Take care not to damage the plant by cutting into the growing point. Add some fertilizer to the soil and water every three to four days. The plant will grow new leaves and within four weeks the spinach will be ready for harvesting again.

Dealing With Pests and Diseases
When watering spinach, don’t water the foliage. If the leaves remain moist they are likely to develop a fungal infection such as mildew. Fungal infections are difficult to eradicate, and you won’t be able to eat the affected leaves.

Growing spinach indoors helps to keep insect infestation at bay, however aphids do sometimes take hold and attack indoor spinach plants.

The best way to protect indoor spinach plants against aphids and other insects is to grow dill or chamomile in between the spinach, or nearby. Dill and chamomile contain natural properties that repel insects.

Lemon Lime Philodendron: Growing and Care Guide
The lemon lime philodendron is an indoor plant with bright lime green leaves, as its name suggests. This evergreen trailing plant is easy to care for. The lemon lime philodendron is  popular for its year-round show of beautiful leaves and is often confused with the neon pothos, which has a similar appearance.


What Is a Lemon Lime Philodendron?
Lemon Lime Philodendron: Growing and Care Guide

The lemon lime philodendron, also known by its scientific name of philodendron hederaceum, originated in the South American rainforests. European explorers noticed this plant because of the unique greenish-yellow color of its heart-shaped leaves.They took it back to Europe, where they cultivated the plant and it continued to gain popularity.


Although the lemon lime philodendron grows well in a garden, this plant is most common as a container plant and grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches. Its trailing stems are up to 12 inches long and hang down in a cascade of lively color.

Also known by numerous other names, the lemon lime philodendron is sometimes called:

Philodendron domesticum lemon lime

Philodendron cordatum lemon lime
Philodendron lemon lime
Golden brazil
Philodendron scandens lemon lime plant
Areum
Lemon lime heartleaf philodendron
Sweetheart vine
Features of Lemon Lime Philodendron
The lemon lime philodendron doesn’t flower. Its lime-green, almost fluorescent leaves are the most noticeable feature of this plant.

The leaves of the lemon lime philodendron are 7–10 inches long, heart-shaped, and smooth. New leaves are initially yellow with a pinkish tinge and turn bright lime green with exposure to sunlight.

The philodendron lemon lime is easy to care for and doesn’t have any special requirements. This plant typically has a long lifespan.

Light
The lemon lime philodendron needs bright indirect sunlight. In its natural rainforest environment, this plant receives dappled sunlight under the shade of bigger trees. Indirect sunlight provides enough light for the plant to produce chlorophyll, a chemical essential for plant growth.

Exposure to prolonged direct sunlight burns the leaves and dehydrates the plant. Place a lemon lime philodendron in a room that gets lots of bright light, but position the container a few feet away from the window and out of direct sunlight.

Watering
Both the lemon lime philodendron and the neon pothos need to be watered once a week during summer and once or twice a month during winter. When the top half of the soil feels dry, it’s time to water the plant.

Underwatering causes the plant to become dehydrated. Wilting leaves that start turning brown are a sign of underwatering.

Overwatering is bad for the plant because root rot sets in when the roots are constantly wet. Leaves turning pale yellow are an indication of overwatering.

Temperature
Lemon lime philodendrons need warm temperatures between 65° to 80°F during daylight hours and 55°F at night. While this plant can survive in a constant temperature of 55° to 60°F, the optimum temperature for it to thrive is around 70°F.

Humidity
The lemon lime philodendron and the neon pothos are both tropical plants that are used to high humidity levels.The ideal humidity for a lemon lime philodendron is 40% to 60%. At this level, the leaves are able to absorb enough moisture from the atmosphere.

In extremely dry areas, maintain the correct humidity level by using a humidifier or spray the leaves once or twice a day with a mist sprayer. If the humidity is too low, the plant will dehydrate and die.


Soil
Plant the lemon lime philodendron in loose, well-draining soil that has good aeration and gives the roots enough room to grow. Add some peat moss to commercial potting soil to create the right soil conditions for this plant.

This plant prefers slightly acidic soil with a ph between 6.0 and 8.0. Avoid highly alkaline soil, which causes the roots to shrivel.

Fertilizer
Fertilize the lemon lime philodendron monthly during the spring and summer growing period. During the autumn and winter months, fertilize every two to three months. Use any good quality commercial fertilizer.

Over-fertilizing damages the roots and leaves of the plant. Use the fertilizer at half strength to avoid burning the plant.

Lemon Lime Philodendron Propagation
Propagating the lemon lime philodendron is similar to propagating the neon pothos. Propagation is easy and usually succeeds without problems if the proper methods are used.

Propagating Cuttings in Water
Use a clean, sharp scissors to cut a stem from the lemon lime philodendron. Cut a 4 inch long piece and place the stem in a jar of clean water, making sure that the leaf nodes are under water. Place the cutting in indirect sunlight in a bright room, and change the water every three days.


After two to three weeks, the cutting will start to sprout. Once the new roots are clearly visible, transfer the rooted cutting to a small pot with some potting soil. A new plant will soon start growing.

Propagating Cuttings in Soil
Propagating the lemon lime philodendron directly in the soil is also possible. Take a few cuttings and insert them directly into a pot of prepared soil. Place the pot in indirect sunlight, and water the cuttings every few days.

The cuttings will sprout and take root in the soil. After three weeks, gently pull on the cuttings. If you feel some resistance, you’ll know that the roots have taken. The plant will continue to grow and can be transferred to a larger pot when needed.

Lemon Lime Philodendron Transplanting
Lemon Lime Philodendron Transplanting

After about three years of healthy growth, the lemon lime philodendron often becomes too dense for its container. At this point the plant should be divided and repotted.

Separate the plant into clusters and repot, planting two to three clusters per pot. Place the pots in indirect sunlight and water every few days until the roots have settled. Repeat the process every three years, or when the plants become too thick and full for their containers.

Common Problems When Caring for a Lemon Lime Philodendron
Common Problems When Caring for a Lemon Lime Philodendron

Although the lemon lime philodendron is quite easy to grow, be prepared for some common problems that sometimes arise with philodendron lemon lime care.

Root Rot Disease
Root rot disease is the result of overwatering. When the roots are constantly sitting in wet soil they become moldy and start rotting. Treat root rot by taking the plant out of the pot and cutting off the damaged roots. Rinse the remaining healthy roots under clean running water, and re-pot in new soil.

Look out for these signs that may indicate root rot in your lemon lime philodendron:

Slow growth rate
Soft stems
Yellowing leaves
Wilting
Bad odor in the soil
Pests
The lemon lime philodendron is prone to pests, like mealy bug and spider mites. Small white spots on the under-side of the leaves are usually a sign of infestation. Treat these pests with neem oil to eliminate them.

Brown Leaves
Brown leaves are an indication of dehydration. Remove the affected leaves by cutting them off as close to the stem as possible using clean, sharp scissors. Water the plant more frequently to prevent further dehydration. If the plant is in direct sunlight, move it to a more shady spot.

Conclusion
The lemon lime philodendron is a strikingly beautiful non-flowering plant with bright lime-green leaves. A trailing plant that hangs down in a cascade of stems and leaves, the lemon lime philodendron grows on a vine and is suitable for hanging baskets. Philodendron lemon lime care is easy.

The Best Types of Lettuce to Grow
Lettuce, an annual plant of the Asteraceae family, is commonly grown as a leaf vegetable. This plant category has clusters of leaves, a short stem, and reaches 19 inches tall. The plant prefers cool weather and comes in a range of colors.


There are hundreds of types of lettuce, each unique in taste, texture, appearance, nutritional properties, and growth habits. Some lettuces have tall heads and soft, dark green leaves, while others are loosely formed, crunchy, and have red-speckled, crinkled leaves.

Lettuces are easy to grow, as long as they’re watered regularly and kept in appropriate soil and light conditions. Species that are slow to bolt, hardy, and fast-growing are ideal for beginner gardeners.


Lettuce Types for the Garden
Types of Lettuce to Grow

While each lettuce is unique in its own right, most lettuces fall into five distinct categories — butterhead, loose-leaf, romaine, crisphead, and stem — based on their head size, leaf shape, and growth habits, and texture.

Loose-leaf lettuce: Loose-leaf species lack a firm head, have loosely-bunched leaves, and come in a range of colors. Most loose-leaf lettuces have a tender texture and a slightly sweet, mild flavor. Leaves can be broad, frilly, smooth, or crinkled
Romaine lettuce: Also known as cos lettuce, romaine lettuce has an upright head, crunchy texture, and dark green, narrow leaves with prominent white ribs. Unlike most other lettuce varieties, romaine lettuces can typically tolerate hot weather
Crisphead lettuce: Also known as iceberg lettuce, crisphead lettuce is round and compact with a dense head and tightly-packed leaves. The outer leaves are a green hue, while the inner leaves are white. Crisphead lettuce doesn’t have a strong flavor and lacks nutritional value, but it’s still widely grown for its crispy texture
Butterhead lettuce: Butterhead lettuce gets its name from its distinctive buttery flavor. The plant is leafy and soft, with a loosely-formed head that resembles cabbage
Stem lettuce: Also known as asparagus lettuce, stem lettuce has a thick stem with small bushy leaves at the top. The lettuce has a nutty flavor and is popular in Asian cuisine, where it’s often pickled and used in stir-fries
Different types of lettuces are often interbred together to form new types. These lettuce fusions rarely fit into one specific category because they exhibit a combination of traits from their parent varieties.

Nevada Lettuce
Nevada Lettuce

Nevada, a hybrid variety of lettuce, is bright green and has distinctive ruffled leaves that form a dense, heavy head. Nevada lettuce is known for its ease of care, tolerance of harsh weather, and crunchy texture.

Nevada reaches 6 to 12 inches tall. The lettuce is particularly well-suited to baby leaf production because the immature leaves are loose, tender, and sweet. The plant matures within 48 days.

Feed this variety regularly to help it develop a dense, compact head. The seeds must be planted 12 inches apart, and the soil should be well-draining and at a pH level of around 6.0.

New Red Fire Lettuce
New Red Fire Lettuce

This loose-leaf lettuce variety gets its name from its vibrant red frilled leaves. It has a crisp, slightly sweet flavor. New red fire is ideal for beginner gardeners because it has high resistance to bolting, copes well in hot climates, and can grow in full sun or partial shade.

How to Grow Lettuce in Your Garden
How to Grow Lettuce in Your Garden

Most lettuces thrive in cool weather, full sun, and loose soil. Different lettuce varieties have different humidity and fertilizer needs. Below, we cover the tips and tricks for growing lettuce in your garden.

When to Plant
Lettuce is accustomed to cool weather and should be planted in spring or as a fall crop. Most varieties can tolerate temperatures as low as 45°F, but lettuces grow best in temperatures between 60 and 65°F. It’s possible to sow lettuce seeds in the winter as long as you grow the seeds indoors in a warm, well-lit environment.


Plant lettuce in areas that receive full sunlight. Certain lettuce varieties, particularly fast-growing species, can happily grow in partial shade. Never plant lettuce in sheltered, dark areas that receive minimal light, and avoid damp, humid areas that lack air circulation.

Lettuce Plant Care
Lettuce is a hardy plant but must be cared for correctly to produce healthy leaves.

Lettuce thrives in temperatures between 60 and 65°F, and in full sun with at least six hours of light per day. In particularly hot weather, lettuce should be grown in partial shade to prevent bolting. The soil must be loose, well-draining, and have a pH level of 6 to 7.5. Add organic compost or a nitrogen-rich fertilizer to encourage fast leaf growth.


Grow lettuce in moderate humidity levels, ideally between 50% and 70%. High humidity can affect leaf yield and make the lettuce susceptible to downy mildew. Keep the environment well-ventilated to reduce humidity.

Water lettuce twice a week or when the soil feels dry. Lettuce kept in containers should be watered more frequently.

Harvesting Lettuce
Loose-leaf lettuces should be harvested after six weeks, or once their leaves reach 3 to 4 inches in size. Whole-head lettuces should be harvested after 10 weeks or when a firm head has formed. Most lettuces reach maturity within 60 days. Harvest lettuce during the coolest times of the day to prevent the leaves from wilting.


How to Grow Lettuce From Seeds
Lettuce seeds can be grown inside or indoors, as long as the temperature remains below 70°F and the seeds have access to sunlight. Sow seeds ½-inch deep in the soil and space them at least 5 inches apart in rows. Mist the soil daily or when it’s dry to the touch. Most lettuce seeds germinate within 10 days.

Use succession planting, sowing the seeds every few weeks, to allow for a steady supply of lettuce throughout the year.

FAQs About Lettuce Growing

Tips for Using Natural Weed Killer
spraying natural weed killer to the flower

Read the following tips to find out the best ways to use natural weed killer.

When to Apply Natural Weed Killer
Choose a sunny day to apply weed killer. For weed killer to be most effective, sunlight needs to dry the weeds after the weed killer has been applied.

Spray the weeds with weed killer during the late morning or early afternoon, so that the weed killer has enough time to dry fully.

Don’t apply weed killer in the early morning. The weeds need to be completely dry before applying weed killer in order for the weed killer to work.

If the weeds are still moist from early-morning dew, or if it has rained, the weeds can’t absorb the weed killer.


Natural weed killer can be used as needed in all seasons, but it is mostly needed during spring and summer when weeds grow prolifically.

How to Apply Natural Weed Killer
Spray the leaves and stems of the weeds generously with weed killer, ensuring that the weed killer coats the top and underside of the leaves, and allow the weed killer to dry fully. Within 24 hours the weeds will start turning brown and will die within two to three days.

Natural weed killer only kills the parts of the weeds that are above ground. It doesn’t kill the roots, so once the leaves have died, pull out the roots of the weeds to prevent the weeds from growing back.

Storing Natural Weed Killer
Store natural weed killer in a sealed bottle in a cool, dark place such as a garage or garden shed. Place it on a high shelf, out of reach of small children.

How to Remove Stubborn Weeds
Stubborn weeds have a resilient root system that regenerates easily. Natural weed killer doesn’t kill the roots.

Once the foliage has died off (two to three days after being treated with weed killer), be sure to pull out all the roots. If a small piece of a root remains in the ground, the weed can grow back.

How to Prevent Weeds
The most effective way to prevent weeds from growing through brick paving is to put down a layer of landscape fabric before paving.

Landscape fabric prevents the weeds’ seeds from germinating and growing through the ground’s surface.

In flower beds, a layer of mulch helps prevent weeds from growing. The mulch protects the flowers while suppressing the weeds.

Special Precautions When Using Natural Weed Killer
Three-ingredient natural weed killer kills all living plants, not only weeds. Take care to ensure that the weed killer only lands on the weeds. If the weed killer comes into contact with desired plants, the weed killer will kill the plants.
Wear gloves to protect the skin while spraying the weed killer. Although three-ingredient weed killer doesn’t contain any dangerous chemicals, the acetic acid in the vinegar can irritate skin.
Wear a mask and protective goggles while spraying the weed killer, because the mixture gives off strong fumes. Although the fumes aren’t toxic, they may still cause discomfort by stinging the eyes and causing tightness in the chest if inhaled.
Natural Weed Killer Alternatives
If Epsom salt isn’t available, replace it with regular salt in the three-ingredient recipe for natural weed killer.

When using regular salt in place of Epsom salt, if the weeds don’t die after the first application, apply the weed killer again two or three days later.

An even simpler alternative to three-ingredient weed killer is salt diluted with water at a ratio of 1 part salt to 3 parts water.

Spray both the leaves and stems of the weeds thoroughly with the salt water solution. Repeat the application daily until the leaves turn brown and die.

Polka dot begonia is a beautiful evergreen tropical plant native to the hot and humid forests of Brazil. Polka dot begonia, also known as begonia maculata, receives its name from characteristic white dots on its bright-green leaves. Polka dot begonias are easy-to-care-for plants suitable for a beginner interested in indoor gardening and will make a fun and colorful addition to any home. 


What Is Polka Dot Begonia: Origin and Description
Begonia maculata is an evergreen perennial plant originating from the tropical forests of southeastern Brazil. The polka dot begonia plant commonly grows in rainforests in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo. This plant variety has also been introduced to other countries in the region, including Mexico, Argentina, and Cuba. The conditions of these plants’ natural habitat dictate the environment they need at home to thrive. 

Polka dot begonia is a plant species that belongs to the family Begoniaceae, genus Begonia. The species known as begonia maculata are recognized by its prolonged leaf shape covered by white or silver dots, giving the plant its common name. Polka dot begonias can grow up to four feet in height. These plants also develop cascading white flowers in the growing season that make their appearance even more striking.  


Other names by which polka dot begonia or begonia maculata is known are clown begonia, wightii begonia, spotted begonia, or spotty begonia.

Features of Begonia Maculata
Polka dot begonia is an evergreen plant with bright green foliage made of uniquely shaped leaves that remind some of the shapes of an angel wing. This plant is also a variety of cane begonias, which is a group of begonia plants, also known as angel wing begonia, recognized by their thick bamboo-like stems and long leaves with sharp edges. 

Taking care of a polka dot begonia is not very difficult and can be easily done by a novice plant grower. However, these begonias require some specific conditions to be maintained to stay healthy, such as a fixed temperature range, regular watering, moderate light, and high humidity. However, it is important to avoid overwatering and overmisting that can lead to the development of plant disease and appearance of pests. 


Light
Polka dot begonia is a light-loving plant that enjoys some bright light now and then. However, begonia maculata will benefit from staying out of the direct sun. Direct sunlight can cause fading of the silver spots, making the plant so special, as well as turn the plant’s leaf tips brown. 

The best solution is to put the polka dot begonia in bright indirect light at home. In the winter, the plant can benefit from being placed on a window sill on the southern side, while the eastern or western exposure works well throughout the year. Polka dot begonia can also survive in limited light, but this won’t be beneficial for the plant for longer periods of time. When the begonia is not getting enough light, its leaves will start losing color. 

Water
The polka dot begonia plants enjoy moist soil and, like most houseplants, require regular watering. However, polka dots will most likely suffer from overwatering, so it’s important to avoid soggy soil at all costs. Begonia maculata doesn’t tolerate soggy roots for a long time and will develop root rot if that’s the case.   


To water the polka dot begonia, allow the top inch of the soil to dry before the next portion of water. If the soil is still moist, it’s better to not water the begonia yet. Polka dot begonias should be watered every 3–4 days in the summer season and once a week in the winter.

Temperature
Polka dot begonia is a great plant for indoor gardening since it enjoys relatively high stable temperatures that are harder to maintain outdoors. The best temperature range for begonica maculata plants is between 65°F and 86°F. It’s important to keep the plant out of drafts and never allow the temperature in the room to go below 59°F because it can cause the death of the plant. 

Humidity
Polka dots thrive in relatively high humidity, similar to the tropical environment of its natural habitat. It’s best to maintain the humidity level at 45% or higher. Use a digital hygrometer to ensure the level of humidity is consistent. It’s especially important to maintain high humidity levels in the winter, since the heating tends to make the air drier.


The best way to keep the humidity level stable is to add a humidifier in the room and keep it near the plant. Or, introduce a pebble tray covered with water to ensure consistent humidity. To do so, put a layer of pebbles on a tray, then pour some water to cover the stones about halfway, and place the pot with begonia maculata on top of the tray.  

Soil
Begonia maculata benefits from a well-draining soil, like most houseplants. A commercial potting mix or  palm soil mix are appropriate options for a polka dot begonia plant. But a grower can also make a mix of soil at home to enhance the quality of conditions for the polka dot begonia. Try mixing some perlite or and wood chips for better humidity and aeration. 

Fertilizer
Polka dot begonias benefit from regular fertilization every two to four weeks to ensure balanced growth and development of the plant. It’s best to choose a water-soluble fertilizer for a polka dot begonia, or use small amounts of compost to feed the plant. Fertilize the begonia in the growing period from April to September to keep the plant healthy and maintain its bright colors. Stop feeding in the colder period between October and March because the growth of polka dot begonias slows down significantly in winter months, so fertilizer would be ineffective.


When feeding begonia maculata, flush the soil with water every two to three months to maximize the effect of fertilizer and prevent the minerals from building up in the top layers. To do so, pour a lot of water through the soil and allow it to drain through the draining holes of the pot. In addition, make sure not to overfeed the plant because too much fertilizer can burn the plant and damage it in the long term.

Pests
Begonia maculata can sometimes be affected by pests, like whiteflies and mealybugs. However, the use of pesticides may be ineffective in these cases because these pests are too small and whiteflies tend to fly around when disturbed, remaining unaffected by the solution. Insecticidal soap can be more efficient when dealing with these pests. 

Grooming and Pruning
Because polka dot begonias are bushy plants with rich foliage, begonia maculata care also involves meticulous grooming. Polka dots tend to grow quite large, with some plants reaching five feet in height, which can be achieved easier by pruning. Cutting the stems can help to promote quicker growth and stimulate outward rather than upward development. The easiest way to cut the stems is to cut off a part of the stem with a few leaves.

Begonia maculata develops cascading pink or white flowers during the flowering season in spring and summer. The fully blooming flowers are a striking image and made the polka dot begonia even more beautiful. To promote the growth of flowers on polka dot begonia, place the pot with the plant in bright light, for example, on a window sill that is facing east or west.


Begonia Maculata Wightii Toxicity
Some toxins contained in the stems and leaves make begonia maculata toxic. Polka dot begonias are thought to be toxic to pets, like cats and dogs, so it’s best to keep this plant in a place where animals cannot reach it. Signs of poisoning can include vomiting and excessive drooling. If these symptoms are noticed, take the pet to the veterinarian as soon as possible. 

Polka Dot Begonia Maculata Propagation
Polka dot begonia propagation is considered a relatively easy process. Begonia maculata can be propagated either in water or in soil. Start the process by cutting the stem from the original plant with a few leaves on it. Stem cuttings should be at least two inches long to survive and grow. After making a cut, place the stem cuttings straight into water and wait for a few weeks before they develop roots. Or, dip the end of the cutting in root hormone and put it straight into fresh soil.

It’s best to propagate polka dot begonia in the spring or summer during its primary growing season. When making cuttings, make sure to use proper cutting tools to avoid unnecessary damage to the plant. 

Spotted Begonia Re-potting
Polka dot begonia plants benefit from re-potting every year. Because the roots of the plants are very dense, they tend to wear out the soil quickly, which is why potting them into fresh soil every year is good for these plants. 

Begonia maculata does not need changes in pot size too often. These plants can be placed in the same pot with every re-potting, but in fresh soil. However, if the begonia stops growing, a one size bigger pot is possibly required. Polka dots grow heavy foliage, so choose a heavy pot that will hold the plants steady. 

Diseases and Common Problems in Caring For Begonia Maculata
Though begonia maculata care remains easy, keep in mind that these plants can suffer from a number of common diseases that should be treated as soon as possible to ensure the survival of the plant.


Powdery Mildew
Powdery mildew is a fungal infection that affects polka dot begonia frequently. The signs of powdery mildew disease include a powdery-looking substance on the plant’s leaves. Treat the infection by removing the affected areas and spraying the begonia with a fungicide solution. To prevent the disease, which can be hard and long to treat, make sure not to overwater the plant and always allow the top inch of the soil to dry in between waterings. 

Botrytis 
Botrytis is known as another fungal disease that affects begonia maculata. The cause of botrytis is usually in soggy roots that come as a result of overwatering, as well as poor air circulation in the room. The disease manifests itself in wet brown spots on the plant and lowering leaves. Botrytis can be treated with the removal of affected areas and spraying the plant with fungicide. 

Root and Stem Rot
Both conditions come as a result of overwatering and can be prevented by ensuring the soil is properly drained and ensuring no overwatering occurs. Stem and root rot cause the plant’s stems go black. 


Bacterial Leaf Spots
brown leaf tips and edgesBacterial leaf spots are represented by noticeable spots on the leaves. This condition is very contagious and can survive in the plants from one season to another, which is why the infected plants should be discarded.

Conclusion
Polka dot begonia is a beautiful and unique plant that will suit any owner, regardless of their level of experience. Begonia maculata care requires minimal effort and makes this plant a great addition to any household. 

FAQs About Polka Dot Begonia
The following section of the article answers some of the most commonly asked questions about begonia maculata care. 


Are Polka Dot Begonias Rare?
Yes, polka dot begonias are rare exotic plants. However, thanks to the progress made in houseplant cultivation over the years, today begonia maculata is relatively easy to find in plant stores across the United States.

How Quickly Do Polka Dot Begonias Grow?
Polka dot begonias grow relatively quickly. Like most houseplants, these plants’ growing season falls on late spring and summer which is when maximum growth can be achieved with proper care and fertilization. The polka dot begonia can reach four meters in height and become a brilliant floor plant to decorate the house.  

Do Polka Dot Begonias Need to Be Staked?
Polka dot begonias may need staking as they grow taller. Because polka dot begonias tend to grow upward, they need some support, which is when staking can come in handy. Staking can help remove the pressure from the plant, make sure the begonia grows in a balanced way, as well as protect the polka dot from accidents at home.  


Why Is My Polka Dot Begonia Dying?
A polka dot begonia may suffer from too much sun or too much water. If the plant was placed in direct sunlight for too long, it may display yellow leaves and other signs of sunburn, which is a signal to remove the plant from bright light. When overwatered, the plant will show symptoms, such as black and puffy stems, or even signs of fungal diseases. 

How to Prune Basil
Pruning basil encourages the growth of new, tender leaves. Pruning basil also prevents the basil plant from flowering, which takes some of the plant’s energy away from growing the leaves. To prune a basil plant, you can use scissors, hand pruners, or herb snips.


Trimming, clipping, cutting back, cropping, and thinning out are other terms that are used to describe the basil pruning process.

How to Prune a Basil Plant (Step-by-Step)
Pots with growing basil


Here’s how to prune a basil plant:

Step 1: Wait for the Right Time to Trim
Allow your basil plant to grow up to 6 inches tall, with at least six sets of leaves before you begin pruning. You shouldn’t prune the plant too early because the plant needs enough leaves to photosynthesize.

Step 2: Find the Basil Plant’s Central Stem
Look for the central stem or the main stem that grows in the middle of the plant. This stem should be thicker than any of the offshoots and should have leaves growing out of each side.


Step 3: Cut the Central Stem
After finding the central stem, count the leaves upward from the bottom of the plant until you reach the fifth set of leaves. Half an inch above the leaves, make an angled cut using your scissors, hand pruners, or herb snips.


Step 4: Remove Flower Blossoms
As soon as flower blossoms begin to form, remove the blossoms by clipping beneath the blossoms. Flower blossoms are white, yellow, green, or purple, depending on the type of basil plant.

Flower blossoms indicate that the basil plant is focused on reproduction rather than on growth. Each basil plant has months of potential growth. You don’t need to plant more basil plants. Reap the most benefits from just one plant by regularly pruning away its flowers.

For the smallest chance of flower blossoms reappearing, move the pruners down the stem, several sets of leaves beneath the blossom — cut here. Making a low cut like this on the basil plant allows the plant to grow faster than if you only trimmed the plant a little.

Step 5: Store or Use the Trimmed Leaves
Any leaves removed during pruning can be used fresh in the kitchen or dried and stored for later herbal use, like during the off-season. To store the leaves, wash and dry them, then wrap the leaves together in a dry paper towel and place in a sealed plastic bag. Store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

Step 6: Repeat the Process after 10 Days
Ten days after pruning your basil plant, repeat the pruning process following the steps above. Pruning your basil plant regularly will allow the plant to grow thickly, giving a bigger yield of basil leaves.

Give the plant enough time to grow back to its existing size before trimming so that you don’t cut the plant too small, limiting its yield and potentially killing it.

When to Prune Basil
How to Prune Basil


The best time to prune basil is when the plant has exceeded 6 inches in height. After this first pruning, you should prune basil every 10 days.


During the winter, bring basil inside or transfer the plant to a greenhouse. Continue to prune the plant according to how quickly it grows.

Eventually, you should get used to your basil’s growth phases. Within a few months of repeated pruning, you’ll know by the basil’s height and the presence of blossoms that the plant is ready for another prune.

Why Prune a Basil Plant
Cutting basil back is essential for healthy growth, even though removing the stems and leaves from basil seems like the opposite of what you want to do.



Keeping up with frequent pruning will encourage the basil to grow large and leafy. A pruned, well-looked-after basil plant can provide a never-ending supply of leaves.

Pruning a basil plant prevents the growth of flowers. When flowers grow on a basil plant, a lot of the plant’s energy resources are used for blossoming. This means that fewer leaves will grow. Removing flower buds during pruning will direct the plant’s focus to grow new leaves.

Tips for Pruning Basil (How to Avoid Mistakes)
How to Prune Basil


Pruning basil is easy when you know what you’re doing, but it can be daunting to begin with. Follow the tips below for pruning basil, looking after your basil plant, and getting a large crop of basil leaves.

Handle Basil Carefully
Basil is a sensitive plant that can easily bruise, so careful pruning is essential. If you want your basil plant to last as long as possible beyond pruning, don’t forcefully pull leaves from the plant or cut the stems roughly.

Use Hand Pruners, Scissors, or Herb Snips for Cutting
Don’t use your fingers to cut the stem of your basil plants. Using hand pruners, scissors, or herb snips will give a clean cut and prevent damage to the plant.


Grow Basil in Optimal Conditions
Pruning basil isn’t the only way to increase basil growth. If your basil plant isn’t kept in the right conditions, the plant’s growth might be stunted, or the plant might die. Keep basil in moist soil, and water the plant twice a week. Protect the basil plant from frost by moving the plant indoors overnight or covering the plant with plastic covering.

Encourage Growth with Organic Fertilizer
As well as trimming and watering basil to encourage growth, use organic fertilizer every three weeks for the first two months of growth. After this initial growing period, use fertilizer once a month.

Harvest Basil Leaves Sensibly
To prevent damaging or killing basil during harvesting, be careful when removing the leaves. The best practice is to pinch the leaves at the stem and gently pull, making sure that you don’t tear the stem attached to the leaf. Harvest the basil stems from the top down, leaving at least one pair of leaves on each stem.


Avoid Common Basil Pruning Errors
The most common errors with pruning basil are over-pruning (removing too much of the plant and causing it to die), damaging the plant by using your fingers to snap the stem, and pruning the wrong sections of the plant. You can avoid these errors by closely following the instructions for pruning basil in this guide.

The rosalea plant, also known as the potted azalea, is a lush plant with flowers that resemble blooming roses. Suitable for indoor growing, this plant is popular as a specialty gift because of its sweet fragrance and attractive buds that unfurl beautifully as the plant grows.

What Does a Rosalea Plant Look Like?
The vibrant colors of the rosalea plant vary from red to pink to peach to lilac, but pink petals are the most common. Some varieties have bi-colored petals. The oval-shaped leaves are dark green. 


Rosaleas reach a plant height of 1 to 2 feet, with flowers that are 3 to 3.5 inches in diameter.

How to Grow a Rosalea Plant
The rosalea plant is ideal for indoor growing and thrives in the right conditions. When buying one of these plants, selecting a rosalea with a lot of closed buds will ensure a longer blooming period.

The plant pot of a rosalea is often covered with a burlap pot cover. Because these plants are so popular as gifts, their pots are sometimes covered with pretty wrapping paper or ribbon to make the gift extra special. Remove these covers in a timely manner to allow for adequate drainage.


Pot dimensions of 5 inches in height and depth allow for sufficient soil to encourage healthy root growth. 


Rosalea Plant Care
The rosalea plant is easy to care for. Follow these care tips for a healthy plant with abundant pink petals.

Light
Place your rosalea plant in a room that gets a lot of natural light with partial shade. These plants need indirect sunlight for most of the day and shouldn’t be placed in direct sunlight. Turning the pot weekly to allow for even light exposure encourages healthy growth and keeps the leaves green.

Watering
Watering

Keep the soil evenly moist by watering once or twice a week, or whenever the top half of the soil feels dry. Wilting leaves that start turning brown are a sign of underwatering, which causes dehydration.

Avoid overwatering because too much water causes the roots to rot. Yellowing leaves are a sign of overwatering.

The pot needs holes at the bottom to allow for good drainage. Remove excess water from the drainage tray. If the pot sits in water the roots will rot.

Temperature and Humidity
Like most indoor growing plants, the rosalea does best in cool conditions. Maintaining a temperature of 60°F to 70°F encourages long blooming periods.


A humidity level of 40% keeps the plant’s moisture level stable, promoting healthy growth. In an extremely dry environment, using a humidifier helps to maintain the optimum humidity level. 


Soil
Use a peat-based, lime-free soil that is rich in organic matter. Excess lime in the soil causes a nutrient deficiency that turns the leaves yellow.

Rosalea plants enjoy a more acidic soil. For best results keep the pH level around 5.5.

Fertilizer
During the spring and summer period, fertilize once or twice a month with a commercial fertilizer designed for plants that prefer acidic conditions. Use a phosphorous, iron-based fertilizer diluted with an equal part of water.

Pruning the Rosalea Plant
Pruning your rosalea regularly and with the utmost care gives the plant more room to spread as it grows, encouraging longer blooming periods with bigger flowers. Removing dead heads keeps the plant looking neat and tidy.

Use sharp pruning shears for a quick, clean snip, to avoid damaging the plant as you cut the stems. Hacking at the stem with a blunt tool causes trauma to the plant. Ensure that the pruning shears are clean to prevent contaminating the plant with infectious bacteria.

Promoting Reblooming
Rosalea plants will rebloom if they are kept in cool conditions and watered regularly after the flowering season, during the winter months. Maintain a temperature of 39°F to 55°F and water at least once a week through fall and winter to promote reblooming.


Because the leaves store most of the plant’s essential nutrients, you should avoid fertilizing during winter. Adding fertilizer during this period will encourage leaf-growth but inhibit flowering.

Repotting the Rosalea Plant
Repotting in a timely manner gives your rosalea plant the opportunity to grow bigger and produce more flowers. 

Repotting while the plant is in bloom damages the flowers and makes them fall. Wait until the blooming period has ended to repot into a container with bigger pot dimensions. Check that the pot has good drainage holes.


Propagating the Rosalea Plant
Propagate the rosalea plant at the end of the flowering season, as the stems are hardening. Follow these steps for the most successful results.

Using a clean, sharp secateur, cut a few 4-inch long pieces from a semi-hard stem. Taking cuttings early in the morning or late in the afternoon yields the best results
Keep the cuttings moist until you’re ready to use them, by either placing the cuttings in a glass of water or wrapping them in damp newspaper
Prepare a clean pot by filling it with a propagating mix. You can use a commercial propagating mix, or you can make your own by  mixing equal amounts of peat moss and perlite or coarse sand
Remove all flowers and buds from the cut stems, and keep only two leaves on each stem
Cut the bottoms of the stems just under a node and dip the tips of the cut stems in rooting hormone
Use a pencil or a thin stick to make a hole in the soil, and insert the cut stems into the soil
Water the cuttings and place them under a cover made by inserting a piece of wire into the soil and draping a piece of plastic over the pot, creating a tent
Place the container in a spot out of direct sunlight, and water the cuttings whenever the soil feels dry
After four to six weeks the cuttings will take root and can be transplanted into larger pots and moved to a lighter position, where they will grow into new healthy rosalea plants
Common Problems When Caring for a Rosalea Plant
Common Problems When Caring for a Rosalea Plant

Although the rosalea plant is fairly simple to care for, you should be on the lookout for some common problems.


Pests
Spider mites and mealybugs are common pests that are found on the rosalea plant. These are the typical signs of a spider mite infestation:

The appearance of tiny yellow or white specks on the upper side of the leaves
The appearance of fine, silky webs around stems or leaves
Brownish-yellow patches on the leaves or stems
Mealybugs are tiny white insects that are often difficult to see. However, they leave a white, waxy secretion on the underside of the leaves of the rosalea plant, and damage the plant. 

The most successful treatment for insect infestation is with a commercial plant insecticide. Move any affected plants into a separate area away from other houseplants, to prevent the infestation from spreading. 


In cases of stubborn infestation that resists treatment, it’s best to discard the plant before the infestation spreads out of control. Any pots or containers should be sterilized before being reused.

Diseases
Root rot and other fungal infections are common diseases in the rosalea plant. These should be treated as soon as possible.

Signs of root rot include:


Inhibited growth
Soft stems
Yellowing or wilting leaves
Unpleasant odor in the soil
If the plant fails to thrive and starts wilting and turning brown, remove the plant from the container, with the utmost care, and examine the roots for root rot. Any roots that look soft and mushy or smell bad should be removed. 

Other fungal infections can cause the plant to wilt and die. A fungus causes soft furry patches on the leaves or stems. Treat the plant  by removing the affected parts.

Conclusion
The rosalea plant is a popular flowering plant that resembles blooming roses. This attractive plant with its alluring fragrance is a frequently requested item and is highly suitable as a gift. This lush plant, with its dazzling pink petals, makes a lasting impression.
