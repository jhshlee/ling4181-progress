Hey, y’all. I’m going back to 1984 this week to explore the case of the murder of Jonelle Matthews. In December 1984, a 12-year-old girl named Jonelle Matthews disappeared from her Colorado home, starting a mystery that lasted for almost 40 years. A man named Steven Pankey became a key figure in the case, raising a lot of eyebrows with his strange behavior. Jonelle’s disappearance made waves across the country, even getting mentioned by President Ronald Reagan. Her picture even showed up on milk cartons, which made their way to many homes around the country.

About Jonelle Matthews
Jennifer Matthews and Jonelle Matthews
Jonelle Matthews was born on February 9, 1972, in Santa Barbara, California, at Cottage Hospital. She was born to a young 13-year-old girl named Terri Vierra. But soon, her life took a new turn. 

When she was just one month old, Jonelle was adopted by a loving couple from Greeley, Colorado, named James “Jim” and Gloria Matthews. This was a new beginning for Jonelle. She got a new home, new parents, and even a big sister, Jennifer, to grow up with.

Jim and Gloria were caring parents and well-liked in their community. Jonelle’s father Jim Matthews was the principal of Platte Valley Elementary School in Kersey, Colorado, where he shaped young minds and built a sense of community among the students. 

Gloria was a warm and nurturing mother. Together, they provided a safe and loving home for Jonelle and her older sister. But their ordinary family life was about to be disrupted by an extraordinary and heart-wrenching event: Jonelle’s sudden and inexplicable disappearance.

Disappearance

On December 20, 1984, Jonelle Matthews was on stage, performing at her school’s Christmas concert. After the show, her friend DeeAnna and DeeAnna’s father dropped her off at her house. It was around 8:15 PM. With her father at her older sister’s basketball game and her mother out of state visiting a sick family member, the house was empty and silent. 

At about 8:30 PM, Jonelle picked up a phone call, jotting down a message for her dad. Little did anyone know, that call would be the last conversation anyone ever had with Jonelle.

When her father came home at around 9:30 PM, he found the garage door mysteriously open, yet the house was lifeless. Jonelle’s shoes and shawl were casually placed near a heater in the family room, which was her favorite spot. Concern began to creep in when Jonelle’s older sister Jennifer came home at 10 PM and still, there was no sign of Jonelle. 

That’s when their father called the police. The police arrived swiftly at 10:15 PM and discovered footprints in the snow around the windows. No signs of struggle or forced entry could be found, yet with the snow on the ground, it was unlikely that Jonelle would have gotten far without her shoes in the snow.

Where was Jonelle?

Early Investigations and Public Attention

After Jonelle’s mysterious disappearance, local law enforcement secretly monitored Jonelle’s birth mother, Terri Vierra-Martinez, without letting her know that her daughter had vanished.

A decade later, in 1994, Jonelle was legally declared dead. 

In 1997, a heartfelt letter came to the Matthews from Terri, seeking permission to visit Jonelle. Unbeknownst to her, Jonelle was dead. She had hired a search consultant in an attempt to locate Jonelle, and the Matthews had to share the dreadful news. 

Despite the tragic circumstances, this led to the families forming a bond. Jonelle’s parents and sister moved on with their lives, living in different corners of the world, always carrying Jonelle’s memory in their hearts.

When Jonelle Matthews disappeared, it shook her community to the core, but it didn’t stop there. It caught the eye of the Greeley Tribune, which started covering the story from the get-go, bringing the mystery of Jonelle’s sudden disappearance to every breakfast table in town. 

Jonelle’s case even received national attention. The story was so gripping that even President Ronald Reagan mentioned Jonelle in a speech on March 7, 1985. She wasn’t just a local girl who vanished; she became a symbol for missing children nationwide, her name even found its way into the Congressional Record for the United States House of Representatives.

In an effort to spread the word and perhaps find Jonelle, her face started showing up on milk cartons across the country. It might sound strange today, but back then, before social media, this was one of the ways people tried to find missing kids. It was a silent plea for help at breakfast tables nationwide, staring back at folks as they poured their morning cereal.

While the country was looking for Jonelle, the Matthews family was trying to navigate a world without her. They held a memorial service at their local church, planting a chokecherry tree in front of Franklin Middle School in Jonelle’s memory. Unfortunately, the tree died after a few years and a plaque bearing Jonelle’s name also disappeared, almost mirroring the heartbreaking mystery of Jonelle herself.

The Case Goes Cold

Despite the best efforts of law enforcement, and with all eyes of the nation watching, the case of Jonelle Matthews led to a dead end. They had chased every lead, followed every hunch, but the trail went cold. 

Even the footprints left in the snow outside the Matthews’ home, the only clues left by the kidnapper, had been carefully swept over with a rake, leaving investigators with more questions than answers. It was like trying to complete a puzzle with most of the pieces missing. With every passing day, hope dimmed, and the bustling activity around the investigation slowly faded into a grim waiting game.

The impact on the Matthews family and the Greeley community was profound. Imagine your friend, sister, or daughter disappearing one day and never coming back. The Matthews’ home, once filled with laughter and joy, was now a house of mourning. 

The community rallied around them, but the loss was felt by everyone. In school, students struggled to concentrate, their minds filled with worry for Jonelle. At local events, her absence was a reminder of the tragedy that had struck their small town. The unresolved case of Jonelle Matthews turned Greeley from a quiet, safe town into a community living under a cloud of fear and sorrow.

Discovery of Jonelle’s Remains

On a normal Tuesday afternoon, July 23, 2019, some gas workers installing a pipeline stumbled upon something out of the ordinary. They found human remains near a quiet crossroads, about fifteen miles southeast of Jonelle’s home. 

It’s a spot you might miss if you blinked while passing by, hidden among the vast expanses of rural Weld County, the same county that Jonelle disappeared from. It was a discovery that sent shockwaves through the community and breathed new life into a long-stalled case.

When the found remains were taken to the Weld County Coroner’s Office, they ran DNA tests and confirmed what many had feared – they had found Jonelle’s body. The forensic report confirmed that Jonelle had tragically died from a gunshot wound to the head. 

News of this discovery hit Jonelle’s parents and the entire community like a ton of bricks. The cold case that had haunted the town for years was suddenly back in the spotlight.

But, with this heartbreaking discovery also came a renewed commitment to finding justice for Jonelle. Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke took the lead, rallying his team to breathe new life into the investigation. This wasn’t just about solving a mystery anymore – it was about honoring Jonelle’s memory and ensuring that justice was served.

Steven Pankey Becomes a Person of Interest
Steven Pankey
Steven Pankey
On September 13, 2019, the Greeley Police Department dropped a bombshell. They pointed the finger at Steven Pankey, a guy who used to live in Greeley and who even ran for governor in Idaho, as a key suspect in the kidnapping and death of Jonelle Matthews.

Steven Pankey was a Greeley resident, who later ran for governor in Idaho. He lived just a few miles away from Jonelle Matthews’ home and was even a youth pastor at her church. In 2019, Greeley police declared him a person of interest in Jonelle’s abduction and murder. 

They searched his Idaho condo, believing he could be responsible for Jonelle’s fate. But Steven denied knowing Jonelle or her family, stating that he was out of town visiting family on the day she disappeared. Cops didn’t buy his story, and in 2020, he was indicted on first-degree murder and kidnapping charges. He was 69 years old at the time of his indictment.

But here’s where it gets really twisted. Steven’s ex-wife, Angela Hicks, shed some light on his weird behavior around the time of Jonelle’s disappearance. According to Hicks, they did indeed leave town two days after Jonelle went missing, a trip which she says was unexpected. 

Once they were back, Pankey began showing an unusual interest in Jonelle’s case, forcing Hicks to read newspaper articles about it. She even mentioned him digging in their yard around that time and a random car fire on their property. 

And it didn’t stop there. At a church service, when a minister expressed hope that Jonelle would be found, Hicks heard Pankey call him a false prophet. And years later, at his own son’s funeral, Steven made a chilling statement: “I hope God didn’t allow this to happen because of Jonelle Matthews.”

So, Steven Pankey was put on trial in October 2021, but it ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury. They couldn’t agree on whether he was guilty of kidnapping and murder. The jury did, however, find him guilty of making false statements to police. His defense attorney argued that his obsessive interest in the case was due to Asperger syndrome. 

Second Trial and Verdict

After the first trial didn’t seal the deal, the case swung around for a second go. This time, Steven Pankey was on trial again, faced with the grave accusations of first-degree murder and second-degree kidnapping of Jonelle.

Now, every defendant gets to have their side of the story told, and that’s where Steven’s lawyers stepped in. Their game plan was simple: focus on the lack of physical evidence. They pointed out the fact that there were no fingerprints, DNA, or anything else that directly tied Pankey to the crime. They were trying to create doubt in the jury’s mind, that maybe, just maybe, the police had got the wrong guy.

But the jury didn’t buy it. They took in all the evidence, mulled it over, and came back with a unanimous verdict – Pankey was guilty of first-degree felony murder. It was Halloween of 2022 when they dropped this bombshell. 

The result? Pankey got handed a 20-year to life sentence. He’s currently tucked away at the Bent County Correctional Facility in Colorado, and he won’t have a shot at getting out until 2042 when he’ll be a ripe old age of 91. 

When the verdict came in, Jonelle’s dad, the Matthews family, and everyone in the community felt a mix of emotions. There was relief that justice was served, but also a deep sadness for Jonelle, who was robbed of her life too soon.

Final Thoughts
Jim, Gloria, Jennifer, and Jonelle Matthews
Jim, Gloria, Jennifer, and Jonelle Matthews
Jonelle’s case sent shockwaves through the community and the whole country, leading to changes in how we protect our young girls. Her death was a wake-up call, and it sparked a push for better safety measures. People started paying more attention to their surroundings, parents started having serious talks with their kids about personal safety, and schools began implementing new safety programs.

The journey to justice for Jonelle Matthews was a long one, taking nearly four decades to reach the finish line. But this case, as heart-wrenching as it was, showed us that no matter how much time passes, we shouldn’t give up hope. It brought to light the importance of persisting in solving cold cases, those unsolved crimes that often seem forgotten.

The tragic story of Jonelle Matthews, a 12-year-old girl whose life was cut short so brutally, leaves a bitter taste in our mouths. But in its wake, there’s a spark of hope. Hope that other unsolved cases, other “Jonelles” out there, might also find resolution. This case stands as a reminder that we should never stop searching for the truth, no matter how elusive it may seem.

What We Know
Matthew Anfeldt, a 20-year-old from Grand Mound, Washington, vanished without a trace on February 28, 2019.

Born on January 27, 1999, Matthew was of average build, standing around 5’6 to 5’7 and weighing between 100 to 110 pounds. His distinct features included brown hair, hazel eyes, and unique tattoos – a cross and a double band on his right wrist, and another cross on his left hand, between the thumb and index finger.

Matthew Anfeldt
On the day of his disappearance, Matthew was seen wearing a black and gray Chicago Bulls sweatshirt, and gray sweatpants, but weirdly, no shoes. Last seen at the Speedway Grocery on Old Highway 99 Southwest in Grand Mound, Washington, at 5:30 p.m., he displayed a highly erratic behavior that day and alarmed those who encountered him.

Prior to his arrival at the grocery store, Matthew had left his Tenino, Washington home barefoot, leaving behind even his phone. Panic-stricken, he dashed to his neighbors, causing a commotion on the road, even stopping traffic, and screaming that his family had been murdered – a terrifying claim that was later found to be untrue. The distressing scene prompted witnesses to call 911, noting Matthew’s highly unstable state of mind.

Shortly after, Matthew was seen two miles away at the Speedway Grocery. He appeared distraught, his mouth smeared with blood, and his eyes filled with tears. Speaking incoherently and expressing an urgent need to hide, he triggered the grocery store clerk to call 911. Before help could arrive, Matthew bolted out of the store, never to be seen or heard from again.

What could have led to this sudden and unsettling behavior remains unclear. In December 2018, only a few months before his disappearance, Matthew had been assaulted near a pharmacy in Lacey, Washington.

Though he sustained visible injuries, he never filed a police report but did confide in friends that certain individuals were after him, but he wouldn’t say who these individuals were or why they would want to harm him.

Matthew Anfeldt
Matthew’s family, alarmed but unharmed, were left in the dark about what could have triggered his behavior that day. His sister, who had seen him just an hour prior to his abrupt departure, noted that he seemed fine then.

Since Matthew’s disappearance, the cold weather has been a cause for concern, given his inappropriate attire on the day he went missing. And his phone, social media, and bank accounts have been silent, showing no activity since his disappearance.

Hey, y’all. Today I have the story of the tragic abduction and murder of 18-year-old Naomi Irion. In the small hours of a chilly morning on March 12, 2022, an ordinary day took a horrifying turn for 18-year-old Naomi Irion. While Naomi was waiting for a shuttle bus in a Walmart parking lot in Fernley, Nevada, a man forced himself into her car and drove off, with Naomi helplessly in the passenger seat. The chilling abduction, captured on surveillance cameras, marked the beginning of a heartrending mystery that would grip the nation. Naomi’s disappearance would soon turn into a murder investigation, a harrowing journey for her family, law enforcement, and the community of Fernley, Nevada.

Naomi Irion’s Disappearance
On the early morning of March 12, 2022, a terrifying event happened in a Nevada Walmart parking lot in the town of Fernley. That morning, Naomi Irion, an 18-year-old girl, was just minding her own business, waiting for a shuttle bus to take her to her job at the power company Panasonic. But Naomi wouldn’t make it to work that day.

Naomi Irion on the day of her abduction
While Naomi was in her car, an eerie scene unfolded, all of which was captured by Walmart’s security cameras. A man, his identity hidden beneath a hooded jacket or sweatshirt, approached Naomi’s car.

But he wasn’t just passing by or asking for directions – he forced his way into the car, aggressively taking over the driver’s seat and forcing Naomi into the passenger seat. In less than a minute, he drove off, taking Naomi with him, leaving nothing behind but questions and fear.

A few days later, on March 15, 2022, Naomi’s car was discovered, but not in a place anyone expected. It was found in a remote part of Churchill County, a fair distance away from the Walmart.

This discovery raised more questions: How did the car end up there? Where was Naomi? As the investigation continued, the authorities worked tirelessly, hoping to find answers and bring Naomi home.

This case quickly became a priority for local law enforcement. The Lyon County Sheriff’s Office, along with the Churchill County Sheriff’s Office, took the reins of the investigation. The surveillance footage from Walmart played a crucial role in their investigation, providing the only visual account of Naomi’s abduction.

Quickly after her abduction, Naomi was added to the FBI’s Kidnappings/Missing Persons Most Wanted list. And a $10,000.00 reward was offered for information leading to her location. 


More Surveillance Evidence
At first, the sheriff’s team thought the suspect might be someone from a nearby homeless camp. This was because Naomi’s abductor was spotted on surveillance video walking from the direction of that camp. But as the investigation unfolded, it became clear that there was more to this story.

The investigators got a significant lead in the case when they decided to share photos of a vehicle they thought could be linked to the crime.


On March 24, the sheriff’s office revealed that they had nailed down the identity of a vehicle and its occupants that appeared in the Walmart surveillance video just minutes before Naomi was taken. This was a big step forward in their investigation.

According to the officials, this mystery vehicle was seen in the Walmart parking lot around 5:15 a.m., just before the sun was about to rise. It wasn’t just sitting idle either. The vehicle drove around a bit before parking near a median. It was sitting there, in the dark, with no lights on. 

The police also discovered that the footage shows a man skulking around various vehicles in the parking lot. Then, he makes his move. He slips into the driver’s seat of Naomi’s car. And just like that, he drives off, with Naomi sitting helplessly in the passenger seat. 


The Arrest of Troy Driver
Troy Driver
By March 25, the cops had made another big break in the case. They found the pickup truck they were searching for, and they arrested the owner, a 41-year-old mining services worker named Troy Driver. But this wasn’t Troy’s first run-in with the law.

Way back when Troy was just 17 he was involved in the murder of a guy named Paul Rodriguez, who was known around town as a drug dealer.

Rodriguez was shot by Troy’s 18-year-old girlfriend right in the driveway of the Driver family home. Troy and another teenager then took Rodriguez’s body and dumped it off a highway.

Troy pleaded guilty to robbing a convenience store and two service stations and breaking into a hardware store. He admitted to using a gun during these crimes.

The court records from Mendocino County show that for all these crimes, including his part in Rodriguez’s death, Troy was sentenced to 15 years in jail. So, this wasn’t his first serious crime, and it seems like he fell back to his old habits.

Discovery of Naomi’s Remains
Naomi Irion

On March 29, 2022, investigators rushed to a a secluded part of Churchill County. They were led there by a tip related to the heart-wrenching disappearance of Naomi Irion.

The officers scoured the area, their investigative efforts revealing something deeply unsettling—a possible gravesite. Realizing the gravity of the situation, they called in the Forensic Investigative Services team from the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office to meticulously process the scene, hoping to identify the remains and reveal what happened to this person. 

After the discovery at the potential gravesite, a body was found. It was transported to the Washoe County Medical Examiners’ Office, where a series of tests and an autopsy would be conducted. This was a crucial step in not only determining the cause of death, but also the identity of the body.

On Wednesday, the worst fears were confirmed. The body found was Naomi Irion’s body. The news hit hard, extinguishing the fading hope that Naomi might still be found alive. 

At first, Naomi’s exact cause of death wasn’t released, but later it was announced that the cause of death was gunshots to the head and chest.

Arrest and Charges
Troy Driver
Troy Driver
The authorities have pieced together a grim picture of what they believe happened to Naomi Irion. They suspect that Troy Driver, the man who allegedly kidnapped her, used a gun to take her life. They believe this horrifying act happened sometime between March 12, the day Naomi disappeared from the Walmart parking lot in Fernley, Nevada, and March 25.

He’s accused of kidnapping Naomi, not just at random, but with a sinister purpose in mind. The authorities believe he abducted the 18-year-old with the intent of sexually assaulting her and/or taking her life, as stated in the formal complaint.

As I mentioned before, Troy Driver was arrested on March 25, originally on the charge of kidnapping. But as the investigation unfolded and more gruesome details came to light, his charges piled up.

The discovery of Naomi’s body on March 29 in a remote area, led to additional charges against the 41-year-old. Now, he was not only facing a kidnapping charge, but also first-degree murder, robbery, burglary of a motor vehicle, and the destruction of evidence.

But things would only get worse for Troy. Lyon County later added a charge of felony sexual assault. According to court filings, on the morning of March 12, Naomi was waiting in a Walmart parking lot in Fernley, Nevada for a shuttle bus to take her to work at Panasonic.

It was then that Driver allegedly abducted her. What followed was a nightmare – the complaint alleges that Driver raped Naomi, murdered her, and then buried her body in a remote area of Churchill County.

The authorities believe that the sexual assault happened somewhere between 1550 E. Newlands Dr. in Fernley, Nevada and Churchill County. The complaint makes some really serious allegations against Driver.

It accuses him of sexually assaulting Naomi against her will or when she was unable to resist or understand what was happening.

The documents go into disturbing detail, alleging that the assault involved anal penetration. It also suggests that Troy kidnapped Naomi with the intent to sexually assault her and to hide his crime.

The Ongoing Case
Troy is facing some of the most severe crimes you could think of. First-degree murder, sexual assault, robbery, and even destroying evidence.

But Troy Driver, has proclaimed his innocence. Even though he’s being charged with some serious crimes, he stood in court and pleaded not guilty in March 2023.

But Troy didn’t just plead not guilty. He also waived his right to a speedy trial. That means he’s okay with waiting for his trial to start, even if it takes a while. This is his legal right, but it’s not always granted. It depends on the judge and the complexity of the case. 

In this instance, the state judge has responded by setting a tentative trial date for about a year from now. That might not sound “speedy,” but given the seriousness of the charges and the amount of evidence to review, it’s relatively quick.

​Naomi Iron’s family wasn’t surprised that Troy Driver pleaded not guilty. 

Final Thoughts
Naomi Irion
To honor Naomi’s memory, her sister and her brother placed rainbow roses at a makeshift memorial in the middle of the Nevada desert, a gesture that symbolized both their grief and their hope.

In the small town of Fernley, about 40 miles east of Reno, the impact of Naomi’s disappearance and murder was deeply felt. The community had rallied together to find Naomi when she first went missing, and even now, the town keeps her memory alive. 

Rainbows, which became a symbol of the search for Naomi, adorn murals and other places around the town. The local flower shop even sells a special rainbow bouquet in Naomi’s honor. Knowing that others are still thinking about Naomi provides some comfort to Naomi’s family.

Hey, y’all. Thanks for coming back for part 2! If you missed part 1 of 12 Modern Cults That You Can (But Shouldn’t) Join Today, you should check it out for the beginning of the list but also to learn a little about what defines a cult. Let’s get to the rest of the list!

Contents
6. House Of Yahweh
House Of Yahweh-Modern Cults
In 1978, Hulon Mitchell, Jr., a member of the Nation of Islam, decided that he was bored of the mainstream extremism. So, he does what any reasonable person would do, right? He rebrands himself as Yahweh ben Yahweh and starts his own religion, the Nation of Yahweh.

At first, things were going pretty well. The guy was so popular that Miami even gave him his own day. But then, just when you thought it was all peace, love, and patchouli oil, Yahweh goes off the deep end, ordering his followers to murder on his behalf. This little hobby earned him a ticket to prison on conspiracy charges, and he died not long after his release.

Despite all this, he’s still got a small group of die-hards in Miami, who keep his memory alive through Facebook posts that combine religious fervor, anti-abortion memes, and a healthy side serving of homophobia.

Meanwhile, there’s another cult that goes by the name of the House of Yahweh, and they’ve cornered the market on apocalyptic wrongness. It’s run by a guy who used to answer to Buffalo Bill Hawkins, but after a seven-year spiritual field trip to Israel, he decided Yisrayl was a better fit. Together with his brother, he’s convinced they’re the opening act for the Second Coming.

Taking a mish-mash approach to their theology by borrowing from Judaism and Christianity, the House of Yahweh became the ‘it’ cult of the 80s. Yisrayl Hawkins became something of a doomsday prophet meets L. Ron Hubbard, penning a series of prophetic books with titles that could double as B-movie horror flicks, like ‘Devil Worship: The Shocking Facts!’ and ‘Unveiling Satan!’

The House of Yahweh has a rap sheet as long as your arm, with members, including Hawkins himself, doing time for crimes that range from sexual assault to bigamy. Hawkins supposedly shuffled off this mortal coil in 2021, but the church is playing it coy, carrying on as if their leader isn’t worm food. So if you’re ever in the mood for a side of prophecy with your crime, you know where to look.

5. Unification Church
Unification Church-Modern Cults
A guy named Sun Myung Moon has a lightbulb moment in 1954 in South Korea and decides he’s the second coming of Jesus Christ. Instead of keeping this to himself like any normal person with delusions of grandeur, he starts a new religious movement that would make even the most ardent of televangelists blush. This is the Unification Church, or as most people know it, the Moonies.

If you’ve heard of the Moonies, it’s probably because of their mass weddings, which are less like traditional weddings and more like gigantic spouse-swap meets. Yep, they’re known for making couples out of total strangers, often hundreds at a time, all decked out in matching outfits. It’s like a bizarre cross between a speed dating event and a cosplay convention, but with the added bonus of lifelong commitment.

The weirdness doesn’t stop at matrimonial musical chairs. When Reverend Moon kicked the bucket in 2012, it didn’t spell the end of the Moonies. Instead, they just got weirder and worryingly started moonwalking into the realm of American politics. You know, because why stick with just mass weddings when you can also meddle in the government?

In 2021, they rolled out the red carpet for Donald Trump, who, let’s face it, never misses a chance to talk into a microphone. The Moonies are as anti-communist as they come, and they seem to have a soft spot for Trump’s brand of political swagger. This isn’t just an American thing either; a Japanese cabinet minister even had to resign recently due to his ties with the church.

So, there you have it. The Unification Church: matching strangers for life and meddling in politics since 1954. It’s like a reality TV show that nobody asked for but we can’t stop watching.

4. The Larouche Movement
The Larouche Movement-Modern Cults
The Larouche Movment is a political oddball that has been swinging around the political spectrum like a hyperactive pendulum since the swinging ’60s. Yes, you heard that right, this cult — sorry, movement — has been chugging along for over half a century.

In the 1960s, Lyndon LaRouche started a radical leftist group for students. But here’s the kicker, as time passed, this network went from singing ‘Kumbaya’ around the campfire of leftism, to suddenly belting out the anthems of the far-right.

Now, some scholars might get all uppity about calling it a cult. But when your group kicks off as a Marxist faction, then pulls a 180 to become a far-right organization, all while nurturing a healthy reputation for harassment, violence, and more conspiracy theories than an Area 51 truther’s blog, well, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck…

The LaRouche movement isn’t just your run-of-the-mill political flip-flopper, though. They go all James Bond, developing a private intelligence agency and rubbing elbows with foreign governments. Think of it as a cocktail of extreme politics and international intrigue, shaken, not stirred. But like any good thriller, there’s a twist. In 1988, LaRouche and 25 of his comrades were convicted on fraud charges tied to fundraising. Of course, the movement cried foul, claiming the prosecutions were politically motivated.

Fast forward a few decades, Lyndon LaRouche has left the building, and his widow, Helga Zepp-LaRouche, is running the show. There’s a veritable United Nations of LaRouche followers, with parties in France, Sweden, and branches in Australia, Canada, the Philippines, and several Latin American countries. It’s like the world’s most contentious book club, engaging in political organizing, fund-raising, cultural events, research, writing, and internal meetings.

But wait, there’s more! In 2021, Zepp-LaRouche publicly denounced the LaRouche Political Action Committee (LPAC) and its treasurer, Barbara Boyd. According to her, they’ve gone rogue, deviating from the sacred LaRouche teachings. She even accuses them of misrepresenting her and her late husband’s positions. The drama!

So, she did what any scorned cult leader would do—she slaps them with a legal action to stop using Mr. LaRouche’s name, likeness, and anything remotely LaRouche-esque. So, in the end, the LaRouche movement is not just a political network, it’s a wild, twisty-turny rollercoaster ride of ideological shifts, legal battles, and international skulduggery.

3. The Church of Bible Understanding
The Church of Bible Understanding-Modern Cults
If you’re a fan of Seinfeld – and let’s face it, who isn’t? – you might remember the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners, a jovially-named cult with a knack for cleaning rugs and brainwashing followers. They even gave George a hard pass, proving that even cults have standards. Well, strap in, because this slice of sitcom lore was, in fact, inspired by the real-life, much less amusing Church of Bible Understanding.

In the grime of 1976, Stewart Traill, an entrepreneurial evangelist, birthed this curious entity in New York. The Church of Bible Understanding wasn’t just about bible study and group prayers; they had their fingers in various pies – Christian Brothers Carpet Cleaning, a used-van enterprise, and an antique store. These were no side hustles, though. Traill used these ventures to rake in the big bucks. We’re talking millions, which he oh-so-holy siphoned through the church and into his bank account, while his flock barely scraped by.

At its zenith, the Church of Bible Understanding boasted over a whopping 10,000 members. Now, it’s a mere shadow of its former self, with a membership count barely brushing the hundreds. But even after the death of its founder, Stewart Traill, in 2018, this scrappy organization continues to operate. It also continues to make headlines. And not the good kind.

The Church of Bible Understanding recently popped up in the news following a tragic fire at one of their Haitian orphanages that claimed the lives of 15 children. And this has all happened in Scranton, Pennsylvania. So next time you watch Seinfeld, remember, sometimes the wackiest plotlines hide some dark real-world truths.

2. Order of the Solar Temple
Order of the Solar Temple-Modern Cults
The Order of the Solar Temple is a squad of doomsday enthusiasts and Knights Templar fanboys. By the time the ‘90s rolled around, the group had gone from weird to downright horrifying. The leader, a guy with a grudge against shared baby names, decided to off an entire family for naming their kid the same as one of his own.

But wait, there’s more. The Solar Temple cult went full-on horror movie with a staged Last Supper, followed by a mass murder-suicide that left dozens dead. If you’re getting goosebumps, you’re not alone. And somehow, this tale gets creepier. There are still a few hundred members around, and no one really knows what they’re up to. I don’t know about you, but I’d definitely be double-checking my locks at night.

Now, let’s rewind a bit. The Order of the Solar Temple – or OTS for those who like their cults with less of a mouthful – was founded back in 1984 by Joseph di Mambro and Luc Jouret. They set up shop in Geneva with a fancy-sounding French name: l’Ordre International Chevaleresque de Tradition Solaire. After realizing that this was a bit of a tongue-twister even for French standards, they switched to the simpler Ordre du Temple Solaire.

While the OTS hogged the limelight with their dramatics, some historians suggest that the real brains behind the operation was French author Jacques Breyer. Apparently, Breyer had started a Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple way back in 1952. A few years later, French right-wing activist Julien Origas took the reigns and rebranded it as the Renewed Order of the Solar Temple. So, whether you’re into conspiracy theories, grisly crime stories, or just some good old historical mystery, the Solar Temple saga has something for everyone.

1. Remnant Fellowship
Remnant Fellowship-Modern Cults
Ever heard of the Remnant Fellowship Church? No? Well, get ready this story has more twists and turns than a Hollywood thriller, starting with a famous Christian diet program and ending in a fatal plane crash. And yes, I’m still talking about a church.

A religious cult that flew under the radar until the HBO Max docuseries, “The Way Down: God, Greed, and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin” took a magnifying glass to it in 2021. While your average Sunday school this was not, the allegations were serious stuff – child abuse and other sketchy business, but none of the accusations stuck.

The star at the center of this circus was one Gwen Shamblin Lara, the creative force behind the Christian diet program and the church itself. Now, Lara’s church wasn’t just your average weekend worship place. This was a full-fledged life-fixing center, promising healed marriages, joy galore, restored health, repaired finances, and obedient children. Sounds good, right? But many believe it was just another money-making gimmick from the crafty Gwen.

And now, for the real kicker. Gwen, her hubby Joe, son-in-law Brandon Hannah, and four other church honchos met their untimely end in 2021 when their private plane took a nosedive shortly after takeoff. Despite this tragic loss, the church carries on, still hosting Weigh Down workshops, and continuing to make Gwen’s larger-than-life hair a testament to her legacy.

What’s next for the Remnant Fellowship Church? Nobody knows. It’s like a real-life cliffhanger. But one thing’s for sure: most cults might lock the doors at the mere mention of an HBO documentary, but not this one. The legacy of Gwen Shamblin Lara is too big to be contained.

Hey, y’all. Let’s face it, we’re suckers for a good cult story. The creepy allure, the charismatic leaders, the bizarre rituals – they’ve got it all. But hold onto your kombucha, because this isn’t just a trip down Jonestown memory lane. We’re taking a detour into the present, uncovering a dozen cults that didn’t get the memo that it’s 2023 and they’re supposed to be extinct. So join me as we delve into the dark underbelly of society’s secret societies with a list of 12 modern cults that are still, against all odds, recruiting and operating today. Spoiler alert: It’s about to get weird.

Religion or Cult?
Before I get to the list, I want to talk about what defines a cult.

One of the reasons that otherwise intelligent and reasonable people get sucked into cults is that often they appear to be a religious group or just a community of like-minded people. But they are not synonymous. Religions, and cults all bring together groups of people, but they do so in different ways.

Community groups, like your school’s drama club or a neighborhood watch, usually focus on shared interests or common goals. People come and go freely, and while there might be leaders, everyone’s views are generally respected. It’s a bit like a pizza party where everyone gets to pick a topping.

Religions, like Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism, are often broader and deeper. They involve shared beliefs about the world, life’s purpose, and moral behavior. However, there’s usually a wide range of interpretations within a religion, and people still have the freedom to question, disagree, and even leave if they choose. It’s like a big family dinner where some topics might cause a heated discussion, but in the end, everyone is still part of the family.

Cults, on the other hand, are a different beast. They might seem like religions or community groups on the surface, but they have some dangerous characteristics. Cults typically have a charismatic leader who demands total loyalty and obedience. They use manipulation and high-control techniques to keep members from questioning or leaving, sometimes isolating them from the outside world and their families. It’s like being invited to a party that you can’t leave, where only one person chooses all the music and everyone has to dance exactly how they say. That’s not a party anyone wants to be stuck in.

Now that we’ve gotten the background stuff out of the way, let’s get into twelve modern cults that exist today.

12. The Rajneesh Movement
The Rajneesh Movement-Modern Cults
Well, if you’re looking for a wild ride of a story that mashes together peace, love, Rolls Royces, and bioterrorism, then strap in, because the Rajneesh Movement has it all. They’re a crew inspired by the Indian mystic Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, a.k.a. Osho. And these guys were all about standing out. In their heyday, they rocked a vibrant wardrobe that made them look like a technicolor dreamcoat convention. They were referred to as “Orange People” or, in the Indian press, the somewhat less catchy “Oshoites.”

Welcome to the wild world of the Rajneesh Movement, where spiritual exploration meets psychedelic fashion and downright scandalous behavior. Starting in India, this crew, led by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho), took a stand against Hindu morality before hopping over to the U.S. to shake things up with Christian norms.

Settling in Oregon, they founded Rajneeshpuram and eyed a hostile takeover of local government. But they didn’t stop at political aspirations. In an audacious (and sickening) twist, they launched America’s first recorded bioterrorism attack by poisoning salad bars to swing a local election. The plot failed, and the movement’s leaders faced prison time while Rajneesh got kicked out of the U.S.

The movement, however, lives on in India, running a meditation resort in Mumbai that draws 200,000 visitors annually. But let’s be real, there are probably safer options for your spiritual retreat needs.

11.The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints-Modern Cults
Grab your popcorn, because the tale of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) is a wild ride, one that even the most far-fetched telenovela couldn’t conjure up. Imagine this: the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) gives polygamy the boot, and one guy, Ruben Jeffs, takes it as a personal insult. Instead of going along with the program, he forms his own spin-off cult, the FLDS, to keep the multi-wife dream alive.

When Ruben eventually kicked the bucket, he left behind a sprawling family tree – about 20 wives and 60 kids, give or take. One of those kids, Warren Jeffs, took over the family business. And let’s just say Warren made his old man look like a lightweight. The man had a “wives” list longer than a CVS receipt, with a rumored 90 women to his name.

But Warren Jeffs isn’t just your run-of-the-mill, creepy cult leader. He’s in a league of his own. The kind of that makes it onto the FBI’s Most Wanted List for marrying underage girls to male members of his cult, and for taking a 12-year-old bride for himself.

Jeffs’ reign of terror ended when he was nabbed by the cops, tried, and found guilty of two counts of rape. His new address? A cozy cell where he’s serving a life sentence. But Warren is still calling the shots from prison. Through a mix of coded letters and suspected secret recording devices, he’s pulling the strings of his 10,000-strong followers.

So, what’s the cherry on top of this crazy sundae? Jeffs, now a prison author, penned a book as if he were God himself, warning humanity they’d rue the day they locked him up. And all the while, there’s speculation that his brother Lyle has cozied up into the leadership role. It’s a story so wild, you couldn’t make it up if you tried.

10. The Family International
The Family International-Modern Cults
The Family International, a cult that’s been playing the name-change game since the 70s, really knows how to put on a good show. Initially known as the Children of God, this band of religious enthusiasts is the brainchild of David Berg.

Now deceased, his legacy lives on in the form of an “online Christian network” as described by his wife, who’s taken up the reins. Their mission? To share God’s love globally with a cool 1,450 members. The method? That’s where things get murky. And if you’re curious about their stance on child abuse, well, they’ve got a whole webpage assuring you that’s so in the past. Comforting, right?

Berg’s original vision for the Children of God, launched in 1968, was far from a typical spiritual fellowship. Picture a man building his personal harem under the guise of “freedom and individuality”. The United States-based cult became a hotbed for “showing God’s love”, which in Berg’s dictionary meant him and his leadership buddies getting, uh, intimately familiar with the members.

But hey, every cult has its growing pains, right? Allegations of sexual abuse took center stage in the late 70s, prompting a wave of member exodus. The PR savvy Berg did what any cult leader would do – slapped on a new name, The Family of Love, and introduced a hot new recruitment tool, Flirty Fishing. This bizarre campaign encouraged female members to lure in potential male recruits using the age-old bait – sex. And voila, The Family of Love morphed into an all-out sex cult.

Fast forward to 1982, the cult does a 180, ditching its free-love ethos and rebranding as The Family. Out goes the sexual debauchery, in comes the apple pie wholesomeness. Come 2004, another name change saw them becoming The Family International, and today they’re seen as nothing more harmful than a group of religious enthusiasts, hell-bent on spreading love and goodness sans the sex. Quite the journey, huh?

9. The Branch Davidians
The Branch Davidians-Modern Cults
I bet you thought the Branch Davidian cult was history, kaput, gone with the wind after that disastrous 1993 showdown at their Texas compound. You’d be forgiven for thinking that, especially considering the “David” of Branch Davidian, the infamous Vernon Howell aka David Koresh, was among those who bit the dust during the siege.

But no, sir, this cult is like a weird, twisted phoenix, rising from its own ashes, with a splintered-off handful of followers who still predict doomsday and continue to occupy the notorious ranch. Let’s call them the “Branch Dividians”, for lack of a better term.

You see, back in 1955, a guy named Benjamin Roden started the whole movement. But now, there are two separate groups who carry the Branch Davidian banner: Trent Wilde’s “Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventist” and Charles Pace’s “The Branch, The Lord Our Righteousness.” Both offshoots have deep roots in the Seventh-Day Adventists religion, but their teachings? As different as chalk and cheese.

The Branch, The Lord Our Righteousness, really made a splash in ’93 when their leader, David Koresh, decided to play a deadly game of chicken with the police. Koresh had this wild notion that he was the “Lamb” prequel to Jesus Christ, and his divine mission was to father the leaders of a new world. As a result, he slept with a ton of the women in the cult, some already hitched, and a few even underage, which eventually led the ATF to their doorstep on February 28, 1993.

What followed was a 51-day stand-off that ended in an inferno. Four ATF agents got killed, 16 wounded, and 82 Branch Davidians met their maker, six during the siege, and 76 more when the fire engulfed the compound.

So, here we are, years later, and these two factions are still waiting for the second coming of Jesus. Good luck with that, guys.

8. Aum Shinrikyo
Aum Shinrikyo-Modern Cults
Aum Shinrikyo is the cult that just won’t quit. It is the cult behind the notorious 1995 Tokyo subway bioterror attack. Instead of fading away into oblivion like any decent, death-sentenced cult would do, these guys decided to stick around and terrorize under a new name: Aleph.

Aum Shinrikyo’s founder, Shoko Asahara, was an odd cocktail of beliefs, mixing and matching various religious texts to create his own apocalyptic worldview. Proclaiming himself as Jesus Christ in 1992, he preached about doomsday being the ultimate “human relief” and that he could transfer his spiritual powers to others. Seems legit, right?

But things took a dark turn when Asahara and his loyal band of followers unleashed the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995. After a painfully long trial that lasted more than seven years, Asahara and his cronies were found guilty and sentenced to death. Fast forward to 2018, and Asahara, along with six other cult members, finally faced the music and were executed.

You’d think that would be the end of the story, but nope. Aum Shinrikyo had other plans. The cult splintered into two smaller groups, Aleph and Hikari no Wa, and continued to terrorize. As recently as 2019, a guy went on a vehicular homicide spree, injuring eight people in retaliation for the 2018 executions. Spoiler alert: His victims, random people on the street, probably had nothing to do with those executions.

Aum Shinrikyo, a cult that refuses to die, lives on through its offshoots, Aleph and Hikari no Wa. One can only wonder what these guys will come up with next, but for now, they remain under police surveillance – and for good reason.

7. NXIVM
NXIVM-Modern Cults
So, you know the new age spiritual retreats you see advertised all the time? Yeah, you might want to take a hard pass on that. Why? Because you might just be stepping into a web spun by the still-active NXIVM cult. You remember NXIVM, right? That self-help organization that turned out to be a front for sex trafficking, fraud, and a whole cornucopia of other criminal activities. Yeah, that one.

Keith Raniere, the mastermind behind NXIVM, might be doing a long stint in prison (120 years, to be exact), but that hasn’t stopped him from orchestrating a whole orchestra of deception from his jail cell. This isn’t your everyday, run-of-the-mill pen pal situation. No, this involves burner phones, false identities, and secret meetings that make your favorite spy novel look like child’s play. And guess what? Those washed-up actresses from the ’90s? They’re still in on it.

Let’s rewind a bit. NXIVM started out in 1998, seeming all innocent and promising. It was a self-help organization led by Raniere and Nancy Salzman that aimed to help you realize your full potential. Sounds great, right? The catch: it was less about self-development and more about mind control, manipulation, and a good old-fashioned pyramid scheme.

But wait, there’s more! See, Raniere wasn’t just satisfied with messing with people’s minds and wallets. No, he wanted to take it one step further. So, he decided to turn his self-help group into a full-blown sex cult. It’s like a really, really messed up episode of a reality TV show. But the grim reality was that women, including actress Allison Mack and Seagram heiress Clare Bronfman, were brainwashed into becoming sex slaves for Raniere.

Fast forward to 2018, when law enforcement finally stormed the NXIVM castle. The aftermath was a slew of arrests, fines, and jail sentences, with Raniere himself getting the short end of the 120-year stick. But even behind bars, he’s still spinning his web. So, yeah, maybe steer clear of those self-development seminars.

This post is going on waaaaaaaayyyyy longer than I expected, so I’m breaking it into two parts. Stay tuned for Part 2 coming Friday!

Hey, y’all. Is there anything scarier than a clown? Probably, but I think we can all agree that they are terrifying. Remember all those clown sightings in 2016? And what about John Wayne Gacy? You get the picture. And today’s case unfortunately involves a murderous clown, literally the stuff of nightmares. In May 1990, Marlene Warren was shot point blank by a clown at her West Palm Beach home. The clown approached her front door with a bouquet and a balloon before pulling out a gun and then fleeing the scene. All that was left behind was a note saying, “Goodbye.” Are you spooked yet? Keep reading to get all of the details.

About Marlene
Mike Warren and Sheila Warren
Mike Warren and Sheila Warren
At 22, Marlene married Michael Warren, who was 19 at the time. Marlene already had two sons from a previous marriage, and Mike accepted them as his own. Together, they built up various businesses, like a used-car dealership for Michael, which allowed them to live a comfortable life.

Their success led them to the wealthy Aero Club neighborhood in Wellington, Florida, where they owned a 6,500-square-foot house. The community was so luxurious that each home had its own airplane hangar and runway, so residents could fly private planes whenever they wanted.

The Warren Family

However, things weren’t perfect for the Warrens. In 1983, Mike faced legal trouble at his car dealership when customers accused him of changing odometer readings. He was charged with a felony and ended up on probation for 18 months.

And in 1988, one of Marlene’s sons, John Ahrens, Jr., was in a fatal car accident. John was only 22, and that may be the turning point in their marriage because Michael wasn’t there for Marlene like he should have been. 

By 1990, it was clear that Marlene and Mike’s marriage was in trouble. There were even rumors that Michael was having an affair with one of his employees at his used car lot, Sheila Keen. Mike allegedly helped Sheila with her rent and they would take very long lunches together.

Although both Sheila and Michael denied these rumors, Sheila’s husband clearly believed them because he left Sheila.

Knock, Knock

On a quiet May morning in 1990, Marlene Warren was hanging out with her son and his friends, enjoying breakfast around 10:45 a.m. That’s when they noticed a white Chrysler LeBaron driving up and stopping in their driveway.

Then the doorbell rang, and Marlene opened the door to find a figure dressed in a clown suit, complete with an orange wig and clown makeup. The mysterious figure held a bouquet of flowers in one hand and a silver balloon in the other as they approached Marlene Warren’s door. 

true crime books
Assuming it was a harmless prank or perhaps an unexpected surprise, Marlene accepted the flowers and balloon from the stranger. But in an instant, the clown revealed a hidden gun, firing a fatal shot at Marlene Warren. In a terrifying turn of events, Marlene was fatally wounded in front of her son, who could only watch in horror as his mother collapsed to the floor. 

The killer clown fled the scene without uttering a word, leaving behind only a haunting message written on the balloon, which read, “Goodbye.”

After the horrifying gunshot to her face, 40-year-old Marlene Warren was quickly taken to a nearby hospital. She was in a critical state, fighting for her life. Sadly, despite the doctors’ best efforts, her condition didn’t improve. After three agonizing days, Marlene was taken off life support, and she tragically passed away.


Marlene Warren’s tragic death sent shockwaves through the community, leaving friends, family, and neighbors in disbelief. Who could commit such a heinous crime while dressed as a clown, and why? The bizarre circumstances surrounding the murder would lead investigators down a twisted path in search of answers, shedding light on the dark secrets hidden beneath the surface of Marlene Warren’s seemingly ordinary life.

The Investigation and Evidence
Anonymous Tip
The detectives from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Department wasted no time jumping into action, searching for the dangerous clown who had just committed a horrifying crime. Just three hours after the shooting, they received an anonymous tip pointing them toward Marlene’s husband, Mike.

Mike Warren
Mike Warren
When the police found Mike, he confidently told them that at the time of the murder, he was miles away from the scene, heading to the horse track with some friends. This seemed to be a solid alibi, making it difficult to suspect him.

However, the anonymous caller had also given the police another name to look into – Sheila Keen, the woman Mike was having an affair with. Sheila was a 26-year-old mom who was going through a tough time with her husband. She worked for Mike Warren, helping him repossess cars.

The Flowers and Balloon

The investigators found balloons and flowers at the crime scene and knew they needed to figure out where they came from, and in just a few days, they discovered that these items were bought from a Publix supermarket.

When they looked into it, they found out that the woman who bought the balloons and flowers looked a lot like Sheila Keen, the main suspect in the case.

The Clown Costume
But that’s not all. Two people who worked at a costume shop called The Spotlight remembered that a clown costume was bought just two days before the terrible murder. That night a frantic woman arrived at the shop as it was about to close for the day. 

Desperate to get her hands on a clown costume, she pleaded with the shop clerks to let her in. She was insistent on finding everything she needed to transform herself into a clown: a brightly-colored suit, a vivid orange wig, white gloves, a classic red nose, and plenty of white makeup to completely hide her face.

White Chrysler LeBaron

Just four days after Marlene Warren was tragically shot, the police made a significant discovery. They found a white Chrysler LeBaron in a Winn-Dixie parking lot, about eight miles from where the crime took place. Marlene’s son Joe saw the mysterious clown drive away in a car that looked just like this one. 

When the police searched the car, they found some intriguing evidence: orange fibers that looked a lot like hair from a clown wig, as well as several strands of brown human hair.

On the same day they discovered the LeBaron, the police got a warrant to search Sheila Keen’s apartment. According to the police reports, they found something quite interesting inside her home. They discovered orange fibers on some clothes, and these fibers seemed to match the ones from the clown wig found in the car. 

The Life Insurance
Mike Warren was set to receive a considerable amount of money from his wife’s life insurance policy, which he eventually collected in June 1991, amounting to $53,359.37. A lawyer named Christopher DeSantis shared some alarming information with the investigators. He revealed that Mike Warren had asked him about the potential consequences if a husband were to kill his wife and take over her property.

DeSantis explained to Mike that if the husband had a friend commit the crime and there was no way to link the husband to the crime, he would likely get away with it. The lawyer also mentioned that if the person committing the murder wore a clown costume, it would be nearly impossible to identify them, and they could potentially escape any punishment for their actions. I have so many questions about the advice this lawyer gave, but I don’t have any answers. 

And on top of all of that, Mike’s friends said that he didn’t seem all that sad about his wife’s death. Suspicious.

The Long Road to Justice
Sheila Keen
Sheila Keen. Very Subtle, Sheila.
Even though there were some clues hinting that Sheila Keen might be involved in Marlene’s murder, the police couldn’t make any arrests back then. Months and years went by, and the case seemed to be at a standstill. 

Then, in 2013, the police decided to give the cold case another shot thanks to advancements in DNA technology. A hair found in that white LeBaron was linked to Sheila Keen. 

As the investigation continued, the police discovered that Mike and Sheila had tied the knot in 2002 and had moved to Tennessee. There, they were running a burger place called the “Purple Cow.” Interestingly, their employees and neighbors shared that Sheila had not only taken Mike’s last name but also adopted a fresh first name, going by “Debbie.” Okay, Debbie.

Mike Warren and Sheila Keen-Warren
Mike Warren and Sheila Keen-Warren
A person who used to work at The Purple Cow shared a story with investigators that added a twist to the case. They said that one of their coworkers told them about a night when Sheila Keen-Warren had too much to drink and let out a shocking secret.

She admitted to buying a clown costume and killing Marlene Warren. The reason? Marlene was standing in the way of Sheila’s secret relationship with Marlene’s husband.

On Tuesday, September 26, 2017, Sheila Warren was found in Washington County, Virginia, close to the Tennessee border. The police arrested her without any problems or drama.

Sheila Keen-Warren
Sheila Keen-Warren
When the police arrested Sheila Keen-Warren the woman accused of Marlene Warren’s death in 2017, she seemed confused and asked them why she was under arrest and asked for her husband Mike. 

Once she was brought to the sheriff’s office, Sheila casually chatted with the officers until they told her the shocking news: she was being accused of being the shooter in the infamous 27-year-old clown murder case. 

Upon hearing this, Sheila’s demeanor changed completely. She placed her head on the desk and refused to speak another word. 

Plea and Sentence
Sheila’s trial was delayed numerous times and was slated to begin in 2023.

At first, Sheila claimed she was innocent and pleaded not guilty in court. However, during a court session in April 2023, she changed her mind and decided to enter a guilty plea. The deal she made with the court stated that she would serve a 12-year sentence. 

But, her defense attorneys, particularly lawyer, Greg Rosenfeld, told people outside the courtroom that she might be back home in just 10 months. If she had been found guilty without the plea deal, she could have faced a life sentence.

Even though Sheila has been in jail since she was arrested, the judge, Scott Suskauer, agreed to give her credit for the 2,039 days she’s already spent behind bars. This time will be counted toward her sentence.

It’s important to note that even though Sheila pleaded guilty, her lawyer is still saying she’s actually innocent.

Final Thoughts
Marlene Warren
So, after all these years since Marlene Warren’s murder, it’s pretty wild to think the case finally got solved. It’s all thanks to an old DNA sample and the never-give-up attitude of the investigators. We can’t forget how this whole thing shook up the lives of those involved, like Marlene’s son Joe Ahrens and everyone in the community. This case really shows us that, no matter what, we should keep going and never stop seeking justice.

Hey, y’all. Today I’m going to explore the shocking 2016 murder of Knoxville teen Emma Walker. After her mother found her dead in her bed, she immediately thought Emma had accidentally overdosed, but a small hole above her pillow told a different story. So who killed Emma Walker? The community was shaken when they learned it was her boyfriend Riley Gaul.

About Emma Walker
Emma Walker
Emma Walker
Emma Walker was a vibrant young woman, known for her beautiful smile and infectious energy that could light up any room (I really hope someone says that about me if I’m ever murdered, but I suspect they won’t). As a cheerleader at Central High School in Knoxville, Tennessee, she was often seen on the sidelines of football games, enthusiastically cheering on the Central Bulldogs. 

During her freshman year, Emma attracted the attention of Riley Gaul, an 11th-grade wide receiver on the school’s football team. Interestingly, Riley stood out from the usual jock stereotype, as he had a geeky side to him that his friends found endearing. 

Emma’s parents, too, were initially fond of Riley. They saw him as a likable young man with a charming personality that seemed to complement their daughter’s bright and caring nature.

The Murder
One early morning on November 21, 2016, Jill Walker entered her 16-year-old daughter’s room to wake her up for school, only to find Emma Walker unresponsive. Panicked, she immediately dialed the police, who quickly arrived at the scene to investigate. 

At first, they thought Walker might have taken her own life because there was what appeared to be vomit on Emma’s pillow, but then they discovered something peculiar—a hole in her bedroom wall. The fact that there was a hole that seemed to be from a bullet, made the police realize that this likely wasn’t a suicide. What they thought was vomit was actually brain matter. 

A more thorough investigation uncovered another hole in the wall and two bullet casings in the yard outside. Although there was only a small amount of blood on Walker’s pillow, it became evident that she had been tragically shot behind her left ear, resulting in her death.

true crime books
Initial Investigation
As the police began questioning Emma Walker’s friends and family members that day, one name kept coming up repeatedly: Riley Gaul. People mentioned him due to their relationship and how they had witnessed the way Riley treated Emma and spoke to her.

Riley Gaul turned to social media to express his grief over Emma’s passing, sharing a series of tweets and a long Facebook post. In one of his tweets, he wrote, “Rest easy now sweetheart. I love you forever and always.” 

Riley Gaul's Tweets after Emma's Death
The news of Emma’s passing left her friends and family heartbroken. To honor her memory, they held a candlelight vigil at Central High the night following her death. Additionally, her fellow cheerleaders released balloons during that week’s Bobcats’ football game as a tribute to the young girl who had once been such a bright presence on the sidelines.

A Tumultuous Relationship
Riley Gaul and Emma Walker
Riley Gaul and Emma Walker
While Emma and Riley’s relationship started out as a typical high school romance, it didn’t take long for the darker aspects of their relationship to emerge. Friends and family noticed Riley’s increasingly controlling behavior, which began to take a toll on Emma’s happiness and well-being.

At first, Emma and Riley’s relationship seemed normal according to friends. Although Riley didn’t interact much with Emma’s friends, they brushed it off as shyness. However, their concern grew as it became clear that Riley didn’t want Emma spending time with anyone but himself. He became controlling and possessive, dictating what she did and even what she wore.

Emma’s parents, Jill and Mark Walker, started noticing red flags in their daughter’s relationship. As things intensified, they decided to take action to protect her. They banned Riley from their home and took away Emma’s cell phone to limit their communication. 

Despite these efforts, Riley gave Emma an iPod Touch to stay in contact through WiFi. Emma’s parents advised her to break up with Riley, but doing so proved difficult. Eventually, Emma could no longer endure the suffocating dynamic and made the difficult decision to break up with Riley. Unfortunately, this did not bring an end to their troubles.

But Riley didn’t handle the breakup well. He attempted suicide in his college dorm room and exhibited mood swings. His friends noticed his erratic behavior. Riley would often say he was depressed and wanted to hurt himself. Despite the many challenges and setbacks, Emma’s parents continued to support their daughter, grounding her and monitoring her activities, hoping to help her regain her sense of self and well-being.

Days leading to her murder
The Threatening Text Messages
A few weeks after the breakup and only two days before Emma’s murder, her parents allowed her to attend a party at a friend’s house after a football game. 

Late that night, she received a mysterious text message from an unknown number, telling her to go outside alone with her keys and threatening to hurt someone she loved if she didn’t comply. Emma suspected the texts were from Riley, so she and a group of friends went outside to investigate. 

Emma confided in her friend and classmate Zach Greene about the strange text messages, showing him her phone. He recalled that the texts became increasingly menacing, with one message even suggesting they call to hear a loved one’s screams. 

Eventually, the text messages said that the person sending the messages had dropped the person they had kidnapped outside of the party. Together, Emma and Zach found Riley in a ditch near the house, who repeated his claims about being kidnapped. 

Emma, feeling uneasy, told him to leave her alone since they had just broken up. Riley walked off, seemingly defeated.

Later that night, Riley called his friend Noah Walton, telling him he had been kidnapped. Noah said that Riley sounded like he had been crying or fatigued, but he didn’t believe his story. Riley urged Noah not to call the police, insisting there should be no involvement of the authorities. Similarly, none of Emma’s friends reported the alleged kidnapping to the police that night.

The Man in Black
The very next morning, Emma found herself face-to-face with a frightening situation. She came home and immediately texted her friends, describing a mysterious stranger dressed all in black at her doorstep. The stranger persistently rang her doorbell, leaving Emma terrified for her life. Feeling desperate, she reached out to Riley Gaul, telling him, “I hate you but I need you right now.” Without hesitation, Riley responded, promising to arrive as quickly as he could.

Upon returning home, Emma’s mother, Jill, discovered her daughter in the front yard with Riley, who was not allowed at their house. Frustrated, she confronted him. Despite his claims of wanting to help and ensure Emma’s safety, Jill insisted he leave, and he reluctantly complied. Later, Jill shared her suspicion with Emma that Riley might be orchestrating the mysterious stranger’s appearance. However, Emma was unwilling to believe that Riley was behind it.

Worried for their daughter’s safety, Jill and her husband decided to keep a watchful eye on Emma. They followed her to work and back home the following Sunday, making sure she was safe at all times. That night, Emma went to bed, completely unaware of the tragic events that were about to unfold.

Riley’s Friends’ Concerns
Rileys friends grew increasingly worried about his well-being, and after Emma’s tragic death, they decided to share a secret with detectives that Gaul had previously confided in his friend, Alex McCarty. 

The day after Gaul’s supposed kidnapping, he had told Alex about his fear for his life, leading him to steal his grandfather’s gun for protection. Riley told Alex that he was afraid of whoever had killed Emma. 

Another friend, Noah Walton, also had some concerning information to share with detectives. He told them that Riley had asked him how to remove fingerprints from a gun. Riley claimed that he was asking on behalf of his roommate. Understandably, Alex thought this was weird. Just asking for a friend. Right. 

Riley’s Interrogation
Riley Gaul's Interrogation
Detectives called Riley Gaul in for questioning on Monday, the day after Emma’s murder, asking him about his whereabouts over the past 72 hours. Riley claimed he had spent Friday night at his friend Noah Walton’s house. Throughout the two-hour interrogation, he never mentioned Emma Walker by name, referring to her only as “the girl.”

According to the detectives, Riley showed no emotion during the interrogation about the murder of someone he loved. Riley told detectives that he had tried to speak with Emma that weekend, but she wouldn’t engage with him. He said she agreed to talk to him if he helped her write a paper for school.

Riley described a phone call on Sunday night that didn’t go well, as Emma told him cruel things and then blocked his friend’s number. After the call, Gaul said he went to his grandparents’ house briefly before returning to his college, where he broke down in tears in his car for hours over the breakup. The police found Gaul’s account emotionless and seemingly rehearsed.

Detectives knew from Alex McCarty that Gaul had shown him his grandfather’s stolen gun. When questioned about the gun, Gaul denied knowing its whereabouts and insisted he hadn’t shown it to McCarty or asked Walton about removing fingerprints from a gun. The detectives then requested to see his cell phone, prompting Riley to ask if he was a suspect. Despite their questioning, Riley continued to deny any involvement in Emma’s death.

After leaving the sheriff’s office, Riley started texting Alex McCarty, asking why he had told the police about the gun. He also urged his friends not to talk to the police anymore. But, boy, did they keep talking. 

The Sting Operation and Arrest
Riley Gaul
Riley Gaul
By this point Riley’s friends were very suspicious of him, so Alex McCarty and Noah Walton decided to collaborate with the investigators to uncover the truth about Emma Walker’s tragic death. 

As part of a carefully orchestrated sting operation, they were fitted with cameras and microphones to document their interactions with Riley. The two friends, along with detectives, set up a group chat to maintain constant communication during the operation.

Together, they accompanied Riley as he intended to dispose of the gun he had used to kill Emma. Throughout their journey to the Tennessee River, Alex and Noah covertly updated the detectives in the group chat, ensuring that the officers were always aware of their whereabouts and Gaul’s actions.

At one point during their trip, they stopped for fast food, even murderers like Cook Out, I guess. But even during this pit stop, the two friends were carefully gathering evidence to bring the truth to light. 

Once Alex and Noah had laid eyes on the gun, they texted the detectives a code word. The cops swooped in just in time. They found Gaul in possession of the murder weapon, gloves, and black clothing—the same attire Emma had described seeing on the mysterious stranger outside her house. 

The Trial of Riley Gault

Riley Gaul’s trial was filled with tension and emotion as both sides presented their arguments to the jury. The prosecution worked diligently to build a solid case against Gaul, emphasizing his strange behavior, the evidence discovered, and the testimonies from Emma Walker’s friends and family members.

A significant part of the prosecution’s case focused on Riley’s bizarre behavior like wearing all-black clothing, connecting him to the mysterious figure spotted outside Walker’s home. And the heartfelt testimonies from Emma’s loved ones shed light on their troubled relationship and Riley’s obsessive tendencies. 

Most importantly, the discovery of the shell casings and Riley’s grandfather’s gun, which was identified as the murder weapon, provided undeniable evidence linking him to the crime.

On the other side, the defense team aimed to present a different perspective, concentrating on Riley’s emotional state during the time of the incident. They argued that the shooting was unintentional, claiming that Riley never meant to harm Emmaa and only meant to scare her. 

However, despite their best efforts, the defense’s arguments failed to convince the jury. There were two gunshots in Emma’s room, each from a different angle. That’s not trying to scare someone. 

In the end, the jury found Riley guilty on a number of charges, only deliberating for five hours. He was convicted of first-degree murder, stalking, theft, tampering with evidence, and committing a dangerous felony while possessing a firearm. 

Riley Gaul was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The verdict and sentencing brought a sense of closure to Emma’s friends and family, who had suffered the devastating loss of their loved one at the hands of someone they had once trusted.

During his sentencing hearing, Gaul, who remained silent throughout the trial, finally apologized to the Walkers for causing their daughter’s death. However, he maintained that the shooting was accidental.

Emma’s Legacy

​Now that justice has been served for Emma Walker’s tragic death, her mother Jill hopes that her daughter’s story can act as a cautionary tale for others who may find themselves in unstable relationships.

Central High School and the Knox County Commission were deeply affected by Walker’s death. Memorial events were held at Tommy Schumpert Park to remember the bright and promising young woman. This tragedy also prompted efforts to promote awareness of dating violence and stalking within the community. Local institutions have focused on ensuring that students, parents, and teachers are better equipped to identify the warning signs and intervene when necessary.

Emma’s case has also sparked broader conversations about teen dating violence and stalking. The importance of recognizing the signs of such behavior cannot be understated, as early intervention can save lives. Educational resources and programs have been developed to teach parents and teens about the risks and dangers associated with abusive relationships. 

Understanding the dynamics of relationship abuse, violence, and controlling behavior is crucial for everyone, as it can affect people from all walks of life. Recognizing the signs and taking action to protect oneself or a loved one can be the difference between life and death. 

By educating ourselves and raising awareness about these destructive behaviors, we can help to create a safer environment for everyone. Open and honest conversations about the warning signs, resources available, and how to intervene can empower individuals to stand up against abuse and violence, ultimately leading to healthier, happier relationships for all.

Hey, y’all. Today, I have a gruesome case. On March 24th, 2015, a horrifying revelation came to light as Mitchelle Blair, a 35-year-old mother from Detroit, was unmasked for her unthinkable actions. The bodies of Stoni Ann Blair and Stephen Gage Berry, two of Blair’s children, were found in her home freezer, unveiling a terrifying story of abuse, murder, and a family’s unimaginable suffering. Keep reading to explore the chilling case of Mitchelle Blair, a mother who transformed from a guardian to a monstrous tormentor.

The Bodies in the Freezer

In 2015, 35-year-old Mitchelle Blair who was a mother of four was struggling to make ends meet on the east side of Detroit. Family members recalled that Mitchelle had difficulty holding down a job and frequently reached out for financial assistance. However, those requests ceased when her relatives urged her to find stable employment and further her education.

Despite the advice she received, Mitchelle found herself facing eviction on the morning of March 24, 2015, for failing to pay rent. When the eviction crew from the 36th District Court arrived, they discovered that she wasn’t home. They entered the residence and began removing furniture and other items.

But among the belongings, the crew stumbled upon something horrifying. In a white deep freezer tucked away in the living room, they found the frozen body of a teenage girl wrapped in a large plastic bag. The police, upon arrival, made an even more horrifying discovery: another body, that of a young boy, was hidden beneath the girl.

A neighbor quickly revealed Mitchelle’s location to the authorities. They found her at a nearby house with her other two children, aged eight and 17. But nine-year-old Stephen Gage Berry and 13-year-old Stoni Ann Blair were ominously not with her. And with that discovery, the investigators knew who they had found in Mitchelle’s freezer.

​What Happened?
Stoni Blair was 13 years old when her life was tragically cut short. Her brother Stephen Berry was just nine years old at the time of his murder. Their childhoods before their murders were marked by abuse at the hands of their mother. 

Stoni Ann Blair

According to Mitchelle’s account, in August 2012, she found her youngest son acting out sexual behavior with dolls. When she questioned him about it, he claimed his brother Stephen had sexually abused him. Enraged, Blair confronted Stephen, who allegedly admitted to the abuse. In response, she brutally assaulted him, suffocating him with a garbage bag until he lost consciousness.

She confronted Stephen with this accusation, and according to Mitchelle, Stephen confessed. But I think we all know that he was likely just terrified of his mom. 

Mitchelle’s torment of her son continued as she poured boiling water on his genitals, causing his skin to peel away. She forced him to drink Windex and choked him with a belt, asking him if he liked the feeling. Stephen eventually died from his injuries on August 30, 2012, after two weeks of torture. His body was then placed in the family’s deep freezer.

In May 2013, Mitchelle also began to believe that her daughter Stoni was also sexually abusing her youngest son. This prompted her to begin starving and viciously beating Stoni until she died. Blair considered turning herself into the police but ultimately decided against it when her youngest son expressed his fear of losing her.

Following Stoni’s death, Mitchelle placed her body in a plastic bag and stored it in the deep freezer on top of Stephen’s body. She continued to live in the home, acting as if nothing was amiss.

For almost three years, the bodies of Stephen and Stoni remained hidden in the deep freezer, and no one searched for them. Their fathers were not involved in their lives, and Blair had previously removed them from school, claiming she would homeschool them. When neighbors inquired about the children, Blair always had an excuse to explain their absence.

Gabi Blair, a sibling who managed to survive this nightmarish ordeal, recounted her own fear of walking past the freezer where her brother and sister’s lifeless bodies were hidden. She felt incredibly thankful to have made it through such a harrowing experience, given that her mother was akin to a ticking time bomb. As the days went by, their mother’s punishments grew increasingly harsh, and her actions became more erratic and unpredictable, eventually culminating in the devastating loss of Stephen and Stoni.

When the family received an eviction notice in March 2015, Gabi, and Mitchelle, I assume, knew that the truth would finally come out. As the eviction crew discovered the children’s bodies, which had been in the freezer for several years, Mitchelle confessed to a neighbor about the gruesome secret she had been hiding.

Aftermath

Mitchelle Blair found herself facing a slew of serious charges, including felony murder, premeditated murder, and torture. A few months down the line, the 36-year-old mother admitted her guilt in the killings of her two children and, as a result, received a life sentence in prison without any hope of parole.

The courtroom at Wayne County Circuit Court heard Mitchelle’s confession of the savage murders of Stoni and Stephen. She asserted that her gruesome actions were triggered by the discovery of their alleged sexual abuse of her youngest son. It’s important to note, though, that this shocking claim has never been substantiated.

In the summer of 2015, Mitchelle Blair faced the consequences of her actions and admitted guilt on two charges of first-degree murder. Standing before the judge, Blair expressed a chilling lack of regret for the brutal actions she had taken. She argued that the two kids showed no remorse for raping her youngest son, so she would kill them again if she could. Again, there’s no evidence that any sexual assault occurred. 

Presiding over the case, Judge Dana Hathaway of Wayne County Circuit Court handed down a life sentence with no chance of parole. While the death penalty wasn’t an option in this trial, the life sentence guaranteed that Mitchelle would remain behind bars for the rest of her life, unable to cause harm to anyone ever again.

Mitchelle Blair’s youngest son and her 17-year-old daughter were the surviving children. They were removed from the home and placed under protective services. These children, along with other family members, have had to grapple with the horrifying reality that their mother was capable of such heinous acts against her own children

Mitchelle Blair now calls the cold, gray walls of the Huron Valley Correctional Facility her permanent home. She will spend the remainder of her days locked away for the horrifying crimes she committed. Kept at a safe distance from society, Mitchelle will never again have the chance to hurt her surviving children or any other innocent souls. Her life sentence ensures that she remains isolated, paying the price for the unspeakable acts she inflicted upon her own family.

Final Thoughts
The harrowing tale of Mitchelle Blair, a 35-year-old mother from Detroit, casts a somber shadow on the potential dangers that can be hidden within the walls of a family home. 

The unthinkable acts committed by Mitchelle, who mercilessly abused and killed her own children, Stoni Ann Blair and Stephen Gage Berry, have left a lasting impression on their surviving relatives and the broader community. When their bodies were discovered in a freezer on March 24th, 2015, it ignited important discussions about the urgent need for heightened awareness and resources to prevent child abuse.

In remembering Stoni and Stephen, it becomes our responsibility to make sure their heartbreaking story serves as a force for change, inspiring us to take every possible step to safeguard vulnerable children from harm. This appalling case has deeply affected all who have heard about it, and it is essential that we channel this awareness into creating a positive impact on the lives of those around us.

Hey, y’all. Today I have the story of British nurse Lucy Letby. She has been accused of the unimaginable – killing and trying to kill several babies under her care at the Countess of Chester Hospital’s special unit for newborns in the United Kingdom. Let’s dive deep into this chilling tale, unraveling the facts and the unbelievable chain of events that led to her arrest and ongoing trial.

Lucy Letby and the Countess of Chester Hospital
Lucy Letby
Lucy Letby
Lucy Letby was a nurse who worked at the neo-natal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital in the UK. She specialized in caring for newborns, and her colleagues described her as a dedicated and hardworking nurse who showed great compassion to her patients. However, in 2018, Letby was arrested and charged with the murder of eight babies and the attempted murder of ten others.

From March 2015 to July 2016, a series of mysterious infant deaths and collapses occurred in a unit dedicated to caring for newborns. Hospital administrators, deeply concerned by these incidents, sought assistance to review their practices. The findings from the inquiry prompted police to launch an investigation they dubbed Operation Hummingbird.

The investigation into the mysterious deaths was extensive and complex. It began in 2017 after an unusually high number of deaths occurred in the hospital’s neonatal unit. Detectives from the Cheshire Police were brought in to investigate, and they spent over a year reviewing thousands of medical records and interviewing staff and families of the deceased babies.

A year of relentless detective work led the police to identify nurse Lucy Letby as their prime suspect. One crucial breakthrough in the investigation came from the hospital itself. The Countess of Chester Hospital installed new cameras in its neonatal unit, which allowed police to monitor the unit and identify any suspicious activity. It was during this surveillance that Letby was arrested in 2018.

She was first arrested in July 2018 but later released on bail. In June 2019, she found herself under arrest once more. Ultimately, in November 2020, she faced a slew of charges, including murder and attempted murder. It was believed that she committed these terrible acts while she was working in the unit where she took care of newborn babies.

The Victims
Lucy Letby
Lucy Letby
Lucy Letby’s alleged victims were newborn babies who were under her care in the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in the UK. According to the prosecution’s case against her, Letby murdered eight of these babies and attempted to murder ten others. The babies were all extremely vulnerable, having been born prematurely or with serious health conditions, and their families had placed their trust in the hospital and its staff to care for them. 

Child A
Child A was a one-day-old baby boy who tragically died on June 8, 2015. It is believed that Lucy Letby injected air into his bloodstream. The baby was born early at 31 weeks and was in good health in the hospital’s neonatal unit. When Letby started her shift, she took over his care. Shortly after, the baby’s skin showed unusual pink patches over blue skin, which later became a sign of air being injected into the bloodstream. Despite efforts to save him, Child A passed away 90 minutes after Letby began her shift.

Four medical professionals scrutinized the case, with the first expert asserting that the baby was healthy prior to his demise, and the fatal incident aligned with the consequences of someone intentionally injecting air into the bloodstream. Another specialist concurred that the collapse was unnatural and most likely caused by purposeful air injection. A pathologist proposed that the air in the baby’s bloodstream could have been introduced through one of the tubes already connected to him, suggesting a calculated act.

Child B
Child B, twin sister of Child A, was born on June 7 and had some trouble breathing at first but got better. On June 9, her oxygen levels went down, and the small tubes giving her extra oxygen came out.

Around 12:30 AM, an alarm sounded when Child B turned blue, stopped breathing, and went limp. A doctor quickly helped her, and she recovered without lasting harm.

An expert who checked the case thought someone might have purposely hurt Child B, maybe by injecting air into her. The prosecutor noted that both twins had surprising health problems soon after birth, even though they were born early but in pretty good condition.

true crime books
Child C
Child C, a five-day-old baby boy, was allegedly killed by Lucy Letby on June 14, 2015. Prosecutors assert that Letby introduced air into the infant’s stomach via a nasal tube, ultimately leading to respiratory distress and a heart attack. Despite being born at 30 weeks and weighing a mere 800 grams, Child C was in stable condition in the intensive care unit. Oddly, Letby, who was assigned to care for another baby in a different room, was the only one present when Child C’s condition deteriorated. 

An independent medical expert deduced that the infant’s demise was caused by an inability to breathe and a subsequent heart attack. Injecting air in such a manner can indeed inflict harm on a baby, leaving little trace of evidence. Interestingly, shortly after finishing her shift on the day of Child C’s death, Letby looked up the grieving parents on Facebook.

Child D
Child D, a baby girl, is believed to have been murdered by Lucy Letby on June 22, 2015, when she allegedly injected air into the child’s bloodstream intentionally. Born via cesarean section, this little one was already at risk due to her mother’s premature water break. However, she showed signs of improvement while receiving care in the hospital’s newborn unit. That was, until the early hours of June 22, when her condition took a sudden turn, resulting in three rapid collapses.

During the second collapse, the baby girl’s distress was evident as she cried out. After the third, her monitor alarm blared, but unfortunately, she could not be saved. Following the heartbreaking event, Letby reached out to friends, asserting that all the deaths and collapses could be attributed to natural causes. However, when confronted by the police, she struggled to justify why she had searched for Child D’s parents on Facebook after the baby’s passing.

Child E
Child E, a baby boy allegedly murdered by Lucy Letby on August 4, 2015, is believed to have had air injected into his bloodstream. The mother found her son distressed and bleeding when visiting the neonatal unit and was reassured by Letby. That night, the child suffered significant blood loss and passed away. Letby is accused of falsifying nursing notes to cover her actions. She also displayed an odd interest in the family, searching for them on social media multiple times after the baby’s death.

Child F
Child F, a baby boy and twin brother of Child E, is another victim Lucy Letby is accused of attempting to murder on August 5, 2015, using insulin to poison him. After receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition), his blood sugar levels dropped, and heart rate increased, indicating insulin poisoning. The prosecutor stated that no other baby in the unit was prescribed insulin, eliminating the possibility of a mix-up. The prosecution claims that Letby injected insulin into the TPN bag, and she was the only person present during all unexplained collapses and deaths in the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital.

Child G
Child G, born four months early and weighing only 1 pound and 2 ounces, was transferred to the Countess of Chester’s neonatal unit in mid-August 2015. After celebrating her 100th day, her condition worsened. It is believed that Lucy Letby fed her too much milk and possibly injected air, causing severe vomiting and breathing issues. Child G was transferred back and forth between hospitals for treatment.

On September 21st, after allegedly being fed milk by Letby, Child G vomited twice and briefly stopped breathing. Later, another nurse found Letby giving the baby ventilation breaths after the monitor had been turned off. The first two incidents left Child G severely disabled. The prosecution claims these events were deliberate attempts by Letby to kill Child G. Letby later told the police she didn’t recall searching for information about Child G’s parents on Facebook.

Child H
Child H was a baby girl who was allegedly targeted by Lucy Letby on two consecutive nights, the 26th and 27th of September, 2015. This baby had to be resuscitated twice during that time after going through two severe collapses. At the time, doctors were unable to determine the reason for these incidents.

After being moved to a different hospital, the baby girl’s condition improved significantly. Later, she returned to the Countess of Chester Hospital, where she eventually went home. It has been pointed out that when children like Child H were moved away from the Countess of Chester Hospital and Lucy Letby’s care, they often recovered surprisingly fast.

Child I
Child I, a baby girl allegedly murdered by Lucy Letby on October 23, 2015, was reportedly targeted four times with air injections into her stomach through a nasogastric tube. During one incident, a coworker saw Child I pale and near death in a darkened room; the baby needed revival with chest compressions. Later, after Letby was seen by the incubator when the monitor alarm sounded, Child I collapsed again and couldn’t be revived. An expert pediatrician believed the deteriorations were consistent with deliberate air injections, with the final incident involving air in the baby’s bloodstream, causing her to scream and collapse. Letby later sent the parents a sympathy card.

Child J
Child J, a baby girl born prematurely on October 31, 2015, is one of the victims Lucy Letby is accused of attempting to murder. After undergoing surgery, she returned to the neonatal unit in Chester, where her condition improved. However, on November 26, she experienced an unexplained collapse and breathing difficulties while Letby was on duty. Following a seizure, Letby administered a glucose infusion, but the baby had another seizure and required resuscitation. An independent expert found the case concerning, suggesting possible airway obstruction.

Child K
In February 2016, a 25-week-old baby girl weighing just 692g faced a terrifying ordeal with Nurse Lucy Letby, now facing multiple murder charges. Baby K was set for transfer to a specialist hospital, but before that could happen, Letby was caught alone with the baby. The infant’s oxygen levels dropped dangerously while Letby hovered over the incubator, and her breathing tube was dislodged, later found to have slipped too far into her throat. Baby K was transferred but sadly died two days later.

Letby hasn’t charged with Baby K’s murder because it’s possible that the baby inadvertently caused the tube problems herself. 

Child L and Child M
Twin baby boys, L and M, died in a chillingly similar fashion to another pair of twins, E and F. Eight months prior, Let allegedly killed baby E by injecting air into his bloodstream and tried to poison baby F with insulin.

On April 9, 2016, Letby gave an unauthorized insulin dose to baby L and, while that was happening, tried to harm baby M with an air injection. Prosecutors say she upped the insulin for baby L since her attempt on baby F failed.

Letby insists she’s innocent, suggesting the insulin must’ve already been in the bag baby L was receiving. Baby M made a miraculous recovery after nearly dying, and Letby’s defense argues there’s no real evidence she did anything to either baby L or M, claiming she’s being blamed because there’s no other explanation.

Child N
Child N, a premature baby boy, was born in excellent health at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Nurse Letby, accused of attempted murder, allegedly saw the baby’s mild blood disorder as a chance to harm him without raising suspicion. On June 3, 2016, the baby’s blood oxygen levels suddenly dropped, and experts believe this could have been due to an inflicted injury or an air injection. The baby recovered with emergency help.

On June 15, Letby visited the almost recovered baby and reported his oxygen loss, helping him breathe. A doctor later found blood in the baby’s mouth, and his throat was swollen. The baby’s oxygen levels dropped again, but he eventually recovered at a specialist hospital in Liverpool. Experts think the injuries might have been caused by a tube forcefully inserted into the baby’s throat.

Child O
Child O who was one of three newborn triplets and who was the brother of child P was allegedly murdered by a nurse named Letby on June 23, 2016. Before that day, the baby was healthy, but in the afternoon of June 23, he suddenly became very sick. A post-mortem examination showed that he had unclotted blood in his body from a liver injury, which caused him to bleed internally and die naturally.

However, an independent pathologist reviewed the case and concluded that the baby’s liver injury was not caused by the resuscitation efforts. Instead, the expert believed that the baby had been assaulted, and that the injury was caused by an impact. The pathologist also found that the baby had received too much air through a nasogastric tube, which may have contributed to his death.

Child P
Child P, a baby triplet, whose brother (Child O) had just died, was allegedly murdered on June 24, 2016. The baby became very ill, and doctors planned to move him to another hospital. Just before the transfer, Letby asked the doctor if Child P was leaving the hospital alive and then Child P suddenly collapsed and died. Although the coroner initially attributed the death to prematurity, further investigation by independent experts revealed that air had been injected into Child P’s stomach, causing breathing problems that likely led to his death.

Child Q
Child Q is a baby boy who was allegedly targeted by a nurse named Letby. It is claimed that she tried to kill him by injecting too much air and a clear liquid, like water or saltwater, into his stomach through a tube. Luckily, the baby was moved to another hospital where his condition quickly improved.

The Trial

Lucy Letby’s trial began on February 6, 2023, and had been ongoing since November 2021. The prosecution accused Letby of intentionally harming newborns by injecting them with air, causing them to go into cardiac arrest. Witnesses, including senior nurse Kathryn Percival-Calderbank, neonatal assistant Lisa Walker, and consultant colleagues Dr. Stephen Brearey and Dr. John Gibbs, testified that Letby was a “constant malevolent presence” in the neonatal unit.

The trial has revealed Letby’s alleged use of insulin to cause hypoglycemia in her patients, which could have led to their deaths. The prosecution presented evidence of computer searches for information on insulin and its effects, as well as Letby’s access to the drug and her unusual behavior around administering it. And the trial has highlighted the hospital’s failures in safeguarding its vulnerable patients, with a lack of oversight and scrutiny and systemic issues with record-keeping and monitoring.

Another disturbing revelation from Letby’s trial is that Letby wrote a Post-it note saying ‘I AM EVIL I DID THIS’ that was found at her home. Other messages were also found including ‘I killed them on purpose’ and ‘I will never have children or marry.’ The prosecution claims that Letby targeted vulnerable newborns, while the defense says she is innocent and that some of the infants were already unwell. She was arrested three years after the death of her first alleged victim, Baby A. The trial is ongoing, with Letby’s parents supporting her in court.


The trial has brought attention to the devastating impact of Letby’s alleged crimes on the families of her victims. Several family members have given emotional testimony about the loss of their babies and the trauma of discovering that a nurse they trusted may have caused their deaths. Letby has remained composed throughout the trial, with her family in attendance.

The Aftermath
The trial and conviction of Lucy Letby has caused a stir in hospitals across the UK. They’re all looking into their practices and protocols to prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future. The Countess of Chester Hospital has already taken some steps to improve patient safety by following recommendations made by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. They’ve even issued a public apology to the families affected by Letby’s alleged crimes.

The impact of this case has been massive, and the media is being urged to report responsibly without causing further harm to the families of the victims. Hospital managers and patient safety officers are reviewing their protocols to make sure they’re doing everything they can to protect vulnerable patients. This includes checking their record-keeping, monitoring, and oversight protocols, as well as providing staff with ongoing training and support.

The case of Lucy Letby has been a wake-up call for hospitals across the UK, and they’re taking it seriously. They know they need to improve their care and safeguarding of vulnerable patients, so they’re not going to take any chances. Let’s hope these changes will make a positive difference in the lives of the patients and their families.

The case of neonatal nurse Lucy Letby leaves us with a major question: Why did she do it? It’s hard to understand how a nurse who was known for being caring and dedicated could end up harming innocent newborns. Was it the intense stress of working in such a high-pressure environment that got to her? It’s a tough question to answer, and we may never know the full story.

Working in a neonatal unit can be super stressful, with long hours and high stakes. Caring for vulnerable newborns who need constant attention can take a toll on even the most experienced nurses. But that still doesn’t explain how someone like Lucy Letby could allegedly harm her patients. 

Ultimately, we may never fully understand why Letby did what she did. But we can use this case as a reminder of the importance of mental health support for healthcare professionals. It’s crucial to provide resources and support for those who work in high-stress environments to prevent them from becoming overwhelmed and potentially causing harm to patients.

The Lucy Letby case showed us that we need to keep a close eye on patient safety in neonatal units and everywhere else. Hospitals have make it a top priority to keep patients safe, and staff need to stick to strict ethical standards. It’s up to everyone, from the newbie student nurse to the seasoned consultant, to protect our most vulnerable–newborn babies.

Hey, y’all. Today I have a case that influenced legislation and led to the national sex offender registry. In 1989, the kidnapping and killing of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling had a deep and lasting effect on the people of St. Joseph, Minnesota. Despite a decades-long search, the case went unsolved for 27 years, but in 2016, a shocking confession finally revealed the tragic truth about what happened to Jacob. Jacob’s case uncovered not just the terrible acts of one person, but also brought to light a series of distressing attacks on other young boys that took place in the years before Jacob was taken.

The Abduction
Aaron Larson and Jacob Wetterling
Aaron Larson and Jacob Wetterling
On a Sunday evening, October 22, 1989, just after 9:00 p.m., three young boys were riding their bikes back home from a nearby Tom Thumb convenience store in St. Joseph, Minnesota. They had gone there to rent a video.

Jacob Wetterling, an 11-year-old boy, his younger brother Trevor, just 10 years old, and their buddy Aaron Larson, also 11, were happily riding their bikes back home from a nearby Tom Thumb convenience store in the small town of St. Joseph, which is in central Minnesota. The boys had ventured out to rent a video, eager for a fun-filled night together.

While they were biking, a masked gunman wearing a mask made from a stocking cap and carrying an unloaded revolver suddenly appeared from a driveway. He commanded the boys to toss their bikes into a ditch and lie face down on the ground. Then, he asked each of them how old they were. The masked man told Trevor, Jacob’s brother, to run towards a wooded area close by, warning him not to look back or he would be shot.

Next, Heinrich looked at the faces of the two remaining boys, Jacob and Aaron. He made his choice and picked Jacob, telling Aaron to run away in the same direction as Trevor. Aaron, too, received the same bone-chilling threat as Trevor had been given. And just like that, young Jacob Wetterling vanished into the night, never to be seen alive again by anyone other than the monster who had taken him away from his loved ones.

The Investigation
Jacob Wetterling
Jacob Wetterling
In late October 1989, the desperate search for 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling ramped up. The FBI and other agencies joined the investigation, and with tips pouring in, officers and volunteers searched tirelessly for any leads. The Wetterlings decided to go public, hoping that the extra attention would help bring their son home.

An FBI profiler soon joined the case, suggesting the abductor might be a white loner with a dark past. The community united, with hundreds attending a prayer vigil, and the local sheriff speculated that Jacob could be dead. Refusing to give up, the governor activated the National Guard to search a vast area for the missing boy. To raise awareness, a nationwide mailing campaign sent a million fliers across the country. Investigators also released a sketch of a man seen at the convenience store on the night of the kidnapping.

In April 1990, the FBI reported that a shoeprint found at the crime scene “matched” Heinrich’s right shoe, but there wasn’t enough detail to confirm it was definitely his shoe. By February 1991, Heinrich had the property back that had been seized during a search warrant over a year earlier. The case seemed to hit roadblocks, leaving the community desperate for answers.

In 2004, investigators turned their attention to Dan Rassier, a neighbor of the Wetterling family, asking him to admit that he had abducted Jacob. This focus on Rassier persisted for years, with law enforcement even involving Patty Wetterling in October 2009.

She invited Rassier to talk and directly asked him if he had abducted her son. Rassier vehemently denied any involvement in the crime. Despite his denial, on July 1, 2010, investigators searched Rassier’s farm, where he and his parents lived, digging up parts of the property and publicly declaring him as a “person of interest.” The focus on the wrong suspect led to precious time and resources being spent on a dead-end lead, ultimately delaying the resolution of the case.

The Paynesville 8
Months before Jacob’s abduction, a 12-year-old boy named Jared Scheierl was kidnapped, abused, and threatened by an unknown adult man, later identified as Heinrich. The chilling similarities between Jared’s case and Jacob’s raised suspicions.

Meanwhile, several young boys in the nearby town of Paynesville were assaulted by an unknown attacker. These victims, aged 12 to 16, became known as the Paynesville 8 and were often grabbed and threatened by a man sometimes wearing a mask. The assaults often included sexual abuse.

In January 1989, about nine months before Jacob was kidnapped, a 12-year-old boy named Jared Scheierl was taken, sexually abused, and threatened by an unknown adult man. The way the attacker acted that night was very similar to what happened in the Wetterling case.

The man, who was later identified as Heinrich, used a gun and, when he let the boy go, told him to run without looking back, or else he would be shot. This incident happened just 10 miles away from where Heinrich would later confront the Wetterling brothers and their friend.

As time ticked by, it became chillingly clear that Jacob’s abduction wasn’t just a one-off horror show. Despite the eerie similarities between these attacks and Jacob’s abduction, the link between the cases remained shrouded in mystery. It took years of relentless investigating before authorities finally started piecing together the sinister connection between these incidents.

A Break in the Case
Danny Heinrich's 2015 Mugshot
Danny Heinrich’s 2015 Mugshot
In 2016, Danny Heinrich, a man with a criminal history, became a person of interest in the Wetterling case. As part of a plea agreement on unrelated child pornography charges, Heinrich confessed to abducting, sexually assaulting, and killing Jacob Wetterling. Heinrich described the events of that fateful night, revealing that he had been following the boys and had chosen Jacob at random.

In September 2010, law enforcement broke the news that lab tests from a recent search didn’t produce any evidence for Jacob’s investigation. Fast forward a couple of years, and the DNA drama starts to unravel. A mysterious male DNA profile was found on Jared’s sweatshirt from his 1989 abduction and later matched with samples taken from Heinrich in 1990.

In July 2015, investigators searched around Heinrich’s home, uncovering a creepy collection of child sexual abuse images, handcuffs, duct tape, camo gear, and bins full of boys’ clothes. They also stumbled upon hidden videos of neighborhood kids just living their lives. Heinrich, probably sensing that he wasn’t getting out of this one, admitted to having the child sexual abuse images.

Finally, on August 31, 2016, as part of a plea deal to avoid kidnapping or murder charges, Heinrich led investigators to Jacob’s burial site in a pasture near Paynesville. About 30 miles from the Wetterling home and abduction site, the remains were confirmed to be Jacob’s, leaving his family and community heartbroken.

As part of the plea agreement, Heinrich confessed to one count of the 25 federal child pornography charges against him, revealed Jacob’s burial site, and gave a detailed account of the chilling details of the crime. He admitted to kidnapping, handcuffing, and molesting Jacob before killing him and burying his body. Heinrich also confessed to kidnapping and sexually assaulting Jared Scheierl earlier that year.

In exchange, prosecutors didn’t charge Heinrich with Jacob’s murder. He was sentenced to 20 years for the child pornography charge, with the possibility of being civilly committed as a sexual predator after his sentence, potentially keeping him locked up indefinitely. The judge acknowledged the case’s impact on children and parents in Minnesota and beyond, saying Heinrich had “stolen the innocence of children.”

Heinrich began serving his 20-year federal prison sentence in Massachusetts in January 2017. Though he could be released in 17 years, the judge doubted society would ever let him go free due to the heinous nature of his crimes.

Heinrich has never confessed to committing any of the crimes against the Paynesville 8

Justice?

Heinrich’s confession brought a painful chapter to a close for the Wetterling family, who had spent nearly three decades searching for their son. However, the revelation that Heinrich was also responsible for the assaults in Paynesville exposed a history of trauma for the entire community. Many of the Paynesville victims had struggled in silence for years, with the assaults having a lasting impact on their lives.

As details of the Wetterling case and the Paynesville assaults came to light, it became clear that there were numerous missed opportunities in the investigation. Stearns County Sheriff Don Gudmundson stated that the case had “gone off the rails” in the early stages. Despite Heinrich being questioned in the early 1990s, it would take another two decades before he was definitively connected to the Wetterling case and the Paynesville assaults.

Critics have raised doubts about how the investigation was handled and whether the authorities could’ve done more to protect the community. The fact that Heinrich, a repeat offender, managed to dodge capture for so long has left people scratching their heads and wondering how such a terrible thing could’ve happened.

Legacy
Jacob Wetterling
Jacob Wetterling
The heart-wrenching case changed the game for how missing children cases are tackled in the United States. The tragedy of Jacob’s abduction moved his mother Patty Wetterling to create the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act in 1994, setting up a nationwide registry for sex offenders and making our world a little safer for kids.

The sex offender registry is definitely helpful for keeping communities in the loop about sex offenders nearby, but it’s also gotten some flak for its downsides. Critics say the registry can make people feel like outcasts, which makes it tough for them to get back into society, find a place to live or a job, and might even lead to them reoffending.

Patty Wetterling has noticed these concerns and, over time, she’s moved away from just pushing for a registry and started supporting a more balanced approach. Aware of the issue’s complexities, she now roots for well-rounded sex offender treatment programs, prevention efforts, and policies based on solid evidence to better safeguard children and communities.

By doing this, Patty has demonstrated her openness to adjust her advocacy efforts to better tackle the complex issue of sexual abuse and violence. She’s committed to working towards a more effective system that balances public safety with rehabilitation for offenders.

Hey, y’all. Today, we are going to dive into the chilling story of Nebraska killer Nikko Jenkins, an American spree killer whose gruesome acts shook the city of Omaha, Nebraska in 2013. Nikko committed four murders within a month in one of the worst killing sprees in American history, terrorizing the local community and sparking a discussion on the intersection of mental health, the criminal justice system, and the role society plays in rehabilitating—or failing to rehabilitate—convicted criminals. Oh, and the Egyptian serpent god Aphophis is involved.

Early Life and Background
Nikko Jenkins
Nikko Jenkins
Nikko Allen Jenkins was born on September 16, 1986, in Omaha, Nebraska. Raised in an environment with criminal activity, domestic violence, and substance abuse, Nikko was exposed to a life of crime and dysfunction from a young age. Since both of his parents had been in trouble with the law, it wasn’t surprising that Nikko would end up involved in crime as well.

Nikko started breaking the law when he was only 11 years old. As a teenager, he already had a long list of crimes, such as attacking people, stealing things, and having dangerous weapons. In 2003, when he was 17 years old, he went to prison for stealing a car and robbing someone.

The Murders
After serving ten years in prison for the carjacking, Nikko was set free in July 2013. Just a few weeks after getting out, he began a terrible series of murders, taking the lives of four innocent individuals:

Juan Uribe-Pena and Jorge C. Cajiga-Ruiz
Jorge Cajiga Ruiz
Jorge Cajiga Ruiz
On August 11, 2013, early in the morning, around 5:01 a.m., a cop stumbled upon two dead bodies in a white Ford truck out near a city pool at 18th and F St, in Spring Lake Park. The victims, Juan Uribe-Pena and Jorge C. Cajiga-Ruiz, were shot in the head, and their pockets were all empty and turned inside out. They were duped into meeting up with two ladies for a sexual encounter. Nikko’s crazy killing spree started with this out-of-the-blue double murder, which went down less than two weeks after he was sprung from prison on July 30.

On August 19, 2013, Nikko killed 33-year-old Curtis Bradford, a fellow inmate he had befriended while in prison. He shot Bradford twice in the head at close range. On that August morning, a man who had just finished working the night shift at a nearby convenience store discovered the body of Curtis Bradford. It was lying outside a separate garage located at the intersection of 18th and Clark Street. The investigators who arrived on the scene found that Bradford had been shot twice in the back. Interestingly, it turned out that Bradford and Jenkins, the suspect, had taken a picture together for Facebook just a day before this tragic event. Among all the victims, Curtis Bradford was the only one who personally knew Jenkins.

On August 21, 2013, Nikko targeted 26-year-old Andrea Kruger, a mother of three who was driving home after a late-night shift at work. He forced her car off the road, dragged her out of the vehicle, and shot her four times before fleeing the scene. A deputy sheriff discovered the crime scene while answering a call about gunshots. She was lying in the street at the intersection of 168th and Fort St. She had been shot several times in her face, neck, and shoulder with a 12-gauge shotgun.

Kruger was on her way home after working a bartending shift near 178th and Pacific St. Security cameras captured her locking up the Deja Vu Lounge at 1:47 a.m. Later that day, at 6:30 p.m., her gold 2012 Chevrolet Traverse SUV was found abandoned about 12 miles away, in an alley at 43rd and Charles St. Later in the week, Douglas County Sheriff Tim Dunning held a press conference. He shared that investigators believed the SUV had been left there about 2.5 hours after it was stolen. They also found that someone had tried, but failed, to set the inside of the vehicle on fire.

Investigation and Arrest
Nikko Jenkins
Nikko Jenkins
The savage and cruel manner in which the murders were carried out, along with their occurrence in a short period of time, obviously freaked out the Omaha community and led to an urgent search for the person responsible for these heinous acts. As the investigation progressed, Nikko unintentionally provided evidence against himself by making phone calls to the police and local news stations, where he admitted to having killed the four victims as an offering to Apophis, an ancient Egyptian deity.

On August 30, 2013, Nikko was arrested for a separate offense involving a terroristic threat. During a police interrogation, he admitted to committing the four murders and shared horrifying details of the events. He explained to the detectives that he had killed his victims in order to satisfy Egyptian god Apophis. Nikko believed that the god had instructed him to carry out these killings in order to cause chaos and destruction in the world.

Trial and Conviction
Nikko faced charges for four counts of first-degree murder, and his trial started in April 2014. Throughout the trial, his behavior was strange and unpredictable. He made bizarre claims about being connected to Egyptian gods and insisted on defending himself in court. This raised concerns about his mental state, so several psychiatric evaluations were carried out to see if he was mentally fit to face trial.

In 2014, Nikko was found guilty of all four counts of murder. However, his sentencing was postponed because there were still doubts about his mental health. Jenkins went through many evaluations, and psychiatrists had different opinions about his mental condition. Some thought he was pretending or making up symptoms of mental illness, while others diagnosed him with various disorders, like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.

Finally, in 2017, after years of legal struggles and evaluations, Nikko was considered mentally fit for sentencing. He was given the death penalty, making him the first person in Nebraska to receive this sentence since the state brought back capital punishment in 2016. In addition to the death penalty, Jenkins was also sentenced to 450 years in prison for other weapons charges related to the murders, such as using a firearm to commit a felony and being a felon with a firearm.

Nikko is still on death row and has exhausted all of his appeals.

The Aftermath and Public Debate
The gruesome murders committed by Nikko Jenkins and the following court case really got people talking about how mental health fits into the world of crime and punishment. Many questioned how someone with a long rap sheet and obvious mental health problems could be let out of jail without getting the help they needed or someone keeping an eye on them. Nikko’s situation showed that the system isn’t perfect and that people who’ve been locked up often don’t get the mental health care and support they need to get back on their feet.

Plus, this case got people debating whether it’s right to give the death penalty to someone who might not be all there in the head. Some folks say it’s not fair to execute someone if their mind isn’t working right, because it brings up all sorts of ethical and legal issues.

So, Nebraska has taken steps to improve its criminal justice system and mental health services. They’re working on making things better for people in jail and even after they get out. This way, they can get back into society more easily and not end up back in jail again.

Nikko’s case also highlights the importance of understanding and addressing the root causes of criminal behavior. We can’t forget that not taking care of people’s mental health can lead to some really bad outcomes, not just for them but for everyone around them too.

Final Thoughts
The scary story of Nikko Jenkins is like a warning for us all about how mental health, the United States justice system, and not having enough help for people with mental health issues who need it can mix together in a really bad way. What Nikko did has left a permanent scar on Omaha and the families of the people he hurt. It’s also made people think about how we all have a part to play in stopping things like this from happening again.

We need to keep learning from this terrible event and work on making the way we handle crime and mental health better and kinder. We should understand that it’s not easy for people who get stuck in the world of crime and jail, and try to find ways to help them break free from that cycle.

Hey, y’all. Do you know how many active serial killers are in the United States right now? According to the Albuquerque Times, the number is between 25 and 50. You might even know a serial killer. But before you spiral into paranoia, check out this list of five serial killers that are likely active in the United States.

5. The Chicago Strangler

Source: Chait Goli
The Chicago Strangler, a possible serial killer or even multiple killers, is thought to be behind the deaths of several women in Chicago.

Since 2001, more than 50 women, aged 18 to 58, have been tragically killed in a similar way in Chicago. Most of these victims were African American women, many of whom worked in the sex industry and had previous run-ins with the law. They were often found strangled, with their clothes partially or fully removed, and left in places like abandoned buildings, alleys, garbage bins, parks, or snowbanks. Out of these cases, 25 were closed by the police, resulting in the arrest of 13 men.

Many of these horrifying strangulations occurred in just three police districts on the South and West sides of Chicago. Known for their violent crime and drug use, places like Washington Park and Garfield Park became the center of these murders. In 2018, the Murder Accountability Project (MAP) identified this pattern after examining over 50 unsolved strangulation and asphyxiation cases since 2001. MAP uses an algorithm to sort unsolved homicides by location, victim, and killing method, looking for clusters linked to low clearance rates. Based on their findings, MAP suggests that an active serial killer might be at work.

After receiving pressure from activists, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) stated that they would review 51 unsolved murders of women. However, the CPD maintained that there was no evidence to suggest a serial killer was involved in any of the 51 killings.

4. The West Mesa Bone Collector

Source: Wxstorm at English Wikipedia
In Albuquerque, New Mexico, a troubling pattern of deaths began in 2001. Women started disappearing more frequently than usual.

Nearly a decade later, on February 2, 2009, a woman was out for a stroll when her dog brought her a human bone. That is the worst game of fetch ever. The discovery of this bone ultimately led to the discovery of a massive crime scene that no one could have anticipated.

It took another 11 years to identify all the victims of the so-called “West Mesa Bone Collector.” In total, 11 women and one unborn child were found and identified. The victims came from various backgrounds: while many had ties to drugs and the sex trade, others did not. Syllannia Edwards was only 15 when she vanished, and 22-year-old Michelle Valdez was pregnant when she was tragically killed and buried in the New Mexico desert.

Despite interviewing hundreds of people and investigating numerous suspects, the identity of the West Mesa Bone Collector remains unknown. But despite the lack of evidence, police have a few leads. One suspect is a man who lived nearby and was killed by the boyfriend of a woman he had lured to his home and strangled around the time the murders ceased. Another lead is a convicted rapist with connections to many of the victims and a suspicious collection of women’s clothing and jewelry in his home.

3. The Eastbound Strangler

Source: Dough4872, Public Domain
On November 20, 2006, two women taking a walk stumbled upon a horrifying scene: four women’s bodies had been carefully placed behind the Golden Key Motel in a suburb outside Atlantic City. They found a woman’s body in a drainage ditch, and upon further investigation, police uncovered three more bodies in the ditch, approximately 60 feet apart. Each victim was a woman, placed facedown with her head turned east, fully clothed except for shoes and socks.

Barbara Breidor, Molly Jean Dilts, Kim Raffo, and Tracy Ann Roberts had all been strangled, and their unidentified killer became known as the Eastbound Strangler. The murders happened quickly; Breidor had been missing for about a month before the bodies were found, while Raffo was last seen the day before she was discovered.

Police initially focused on a handyman living in the hotel after his girlfriend reported her suspicions. Although he turned out to be a questionable character—with hidden cameras recording his girlfriend’s teenage daughter undressing—there seemed to be no connection between him and the murders. Another local woman mentioned a man who supposedly confessed to her that he’d killed people around the time of the murders, but he was never charged either. In Atlantic City, it’s probably best to assume any stranger you encounter could be dangerous.

2. The Jeff Davis 8

Source: Oxygen, Murder in the Bayou
Between 2005 and 2008, women’s bodies started appearing in the swamps and canals of Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana. Usually, serial killer victims share similarities, such as age, ethnicity, or method of killing. However, the differences between these eight women are striking. They ranged in age from 17 to 30, varied in race, were found in different situations, and were killed in different ways.

But all of them were involved in the local drug trade and/or sex work, and those with a determinable cause of death seemed to have been asphyxiated.

Weirdly, all the victims knew each other, which is unusual for serial killer victims, even in remote locations. And there’s reason to believe they were all police informants. At least one had numerous charges that were mysteriously dropped, and many informed their families of their informant status.

This could suggest a scenario where informants face retaliation, but evidence points towards either the police or another informant as the perpetrator. It’s unclear why they would target these women, but some speculate that they all witnessed a drug dealer’s death at the hands of the police during a botched raid. If true, it remains uncertain why they were targeted over several years.

It’s also possible that the police covered up the murders to protect a more valuable informant, as they appeared to have mishandled the investigation. Consequently, the victims’ families suspect that the police are involved in the deaths in some way, even though official investigations blame a serial killer.

1. The Long Island Serial Killer

Source: Mark Jenney, Wiki Commons
One dark night on May 2, 2010, a terrified 24-year-old Shannan Gilbert dialed 911 from Oak Beach near Long Island. She was convinced someone was chasing her, trying to end her life. She desperately knocked on doors, begging for help, but then vanished into thin air. For months, the police searched the area and finally stumbled upon a woman’s body near Gilgo Beach along the Ocean Parkway. But it wasn’t Shannan. And as they dug deeper, they found three more bodies, realizing they had a massive problem at hand.

In just a few months, they discovered the remains of 16 people in the area. At least 10 of them seemed to have fallen victim to the same killer. Some had been missing since as far back as 1996, with body parts of two turning up years earlier in a city 45 miles away. Finally, in December 2011, they found Shannan’s body. While her death was officially deemed an accidental drowning, her injuries suggested a more sinister cause.

It became clear that a serial killer had been lurking for over a decade. Family members of two victims received chilling phone calls in 2007 and 2009 from someone claiming to know what happened to their loved ones, but the calls remained untraceable. Shannan’s mother also got a call from a man who claimed to know her daughter’s location, but he later denied making the call and was ruled out as a suspect. Over the years, many suspects have emerged, including a police chief who pushed the FBI out of the investigation, but none have been conclusively linked to the crimes.

In 2020, the new police chief shared an image of a belt, believed to have been touched by the killer, with the initials HM or WH. The case remains wide open, and the search for the elusive killer goes on.

On May 9, 2021, which happened to be Mother’s Day, 13-year-old Tristyn Bailey, a seventh grader at Patriot Oaks Academy in St. Johns County, Florida, was reported missing after her family noticed she wasn’t home to help prepare a special breakfast for her mom Stacey Bailey. By that night another teenager, Aiden Fucci, a 14-year-old classmate of Tristyn, was arrested for her murder and posting Snapchats from the back of a patrol car.

Much of the information in this post comes from an arrest report, which outlines the facts of the case, in addition to court documents.

Tristyn’s disappearance
Tristyn Bailey
Tristyn Bailey | Source: Facebook
On May 9, 2021, Tristyn Bailey was reported missing at 10 a.m. and the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office immediately reached out to the community for help via Facebook. The news of her disappearance quickly spread, prompting the citizens of St. Johns County to cancel their Mother’s Day plans and join the desperate search. It was an incredible community effort.

Tristyn’s mom, Stacy, said that the last time she saw her daughter was when she was sleeping in her bedroom the night before. However, Tristyn’s phone was nowhere to be found, and it went straight to voicemail when they tried calling her. Even the location settings on her Snapchat and Life 360 were disabled.

Stacy also told the investigators that the Florida teenager had never snuck out before, but St. Johns police learned that But here’s the kicker: St. Johns police later found out that Tristyn had actually snuck out of her house to hang with Doffis “Tre” Asher, III, and his friend Aiden Fucci. How the cops found out, I have no clue. But Tristyn did go to Tre’s house that night.

So obviously, the police met with Tre and Aiden to get more information. At first, Aiden claimed that he and Tristyn had left Tre’s house together and parted ways near Tristyn’s neighborhood. However, his story changed later on.

Aiden later said that Tristyn grabbed his private parts, and in response, he shoved her to the ground hard enough to make her hit her head on the concrete. He then refused to provide any further information and requested a lawyer.

And Aiden told the police that Tristyn might be with a drug dealer (named either Carlo or Karlo) who was in his early 20s or that she might be in an area known for teenage drug use. The investigation later excluded this suspect’s involvement.

He said he tried to call her multiple times, but her phone was going to voicemail. The police checked Tristyn’s social media accounts and found that her last Snapchat post was around 16 hours ago, but there were no recent postings on her Instagram.

Here is where things start to get weird. The police received an email with a screenshot of a Snapchat of Aiden throwing up a peace sign in the back of a patrol car with the text reading, “He guys has inybody (sic) seen Tristyn lately.” Not a good look, Aiden.



The email got sent to the investigative team and they asked the patrol supervisor to seize Aiden’s cell phone because it might have some evidence related to the investigation.

During the investigation, surveillance footage from nearby businesses and homes played a crucial role. The footage captured Tristyn walking alone in her neighborhood around 12:30 a.m., likely on her way to Tre’s house. Later on, at 1:14 a.m., Tristyn was seen with Aiden, and again at 1:45 a.m. However, at 3:30 a.m., the footage showed Aiden walking alone, carrying his white Nikes. So, the million-dollar question is what happened to Tristyn?

Discovery of body
At 6:06 p.m., a resident who had been out for a run contacted the authorities to report a distressing discovery – a dead body in a wooded area near a retention pond. It was later confirmed that the body belonged to Tristyn, causing the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office to halt their search efforts and declare the area a crime scene.

By 8 p.m., the sheriff’s office made a public announcement confirming the tragic news that the body of Tristyn Bailey had been found.

Autopsy

At 9 a.m. the next morning an autopsy was underway. According to a post-mortem examination performed by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Predrag Bulic, Tristyn was wearing a black t-shirt that had numerous cuts. The medical examiner believed that Tristyn’s shirt was backward based on the cuts. And her bra was inside out, which made me wonder if there had been a sexual assault.

Based on the condition of her body, Tristyn”s time of death was determined to be between 1:45 a.m. and 3:30 a.m., which lines up perfectly with the surveillance video footage.

true crime merch
Tristyn suffered an excessive114 stab wounds to her body, mostly concentrated in her upper body – including her head, neck, arms, and back. The sheer number of wounds is mindblowing.

To make matters even more disturbing, the examiner was able to determine that Tristyn had been attacked from behind, which means she likely never saw her attacker coming. It’s a horrifying thought to imagine someone being so vulnerable and defenseless in such a violent situation.

The fact that at least 49 of the wounds were likely defensive stab wounds suggests that Tristyn fought back with all her might, trying to protect herself from the relentless and savage attack. The tip of a knife was broken off in one of her wounds.

Her chest had three stab wounds and her lungs had been punctured. This was ultimately the cause of death: homicide due to sharp force trauma, likely from a single-edged, four-inch knife.

Aiden Fucci’s Arrest and Evidence

Let’s rewind back to that Sunday night before Tristyn’s autopsy. Aiden Fucci and his parents were at the St. Johns County Sherriff’s Office for interviews. Aiden’s parents told him to be careful to not implicate himself and reminded him that the room was being recorded. Which, duh.

And Aiden should have been more careful with what he said in that room. For example, he asked his parents how it was his problem that Tristyn was dead. Another bad look.

Meanwhile, the authorities executed a search warrant at the Fucci household, hoping to find any evidence that could help bring Tristyn’s killer to justice. The search turned up a sheath for a buck knife, which was particularly significant since Tristyn had suffered numerous stab wounds. Additionally, authorities discovered a pair of Nike sneakers and wet jeans that could potentially have been worn during the commission of the crime, along with possible traces of blood in the bathroom sink, further suggesting that Aiden was involved in Tristyn’s death.

In the early morning hours of May 10, 2021, Aiden Fucci was arrested for the second-degree murder of Tristyn Bailey. The arrest warrant was issued based on the fact that Aiden was the last known person to have seen Tristyn and the evidence recovered from his home. Not to mention his inconsistent stories.

Remember that knife sheath that the police found at Aiden’s house? Well, they found the buck knife that went with the sheath in the retention pond where Tristyn’s body was found. The knife matched the wounds and fragments on Tristyn’s body.

The wet jeans that were found had been washed by Aiden’s mother Crystal Smith who would later be charged with tampering with evidence. She was seen washing her son’s jeans on a neighbor’s security camera footage. She also admitted to washing the jeans.

Disturbing Fantasies of Aiden Fucci
In addition to the overwhelming physical evidence implicating Aiden in Tristyn’s murder, witnesses came forward to reveal disturbing information about Aiden’s intentions. According to these witnesses, Aiden had expressed a desire to kill someone in the woods by stabbing them, and he had even told his girlfriend about his fantasies.

Aiden had made it clear that he planned to carry out his deadly scheme within a month, and he was telling the truth. These revelations suggest that the murder was not a spur-of-the-moment act but rather a pre

The police discovered a disturbing item in Aiden Fucci’s room: a notebook filled with drawings of a violent nature, including graphic depictions of nude women. These drawings were alarming and raised concerns about Aiden’s mental state and potential for violence. These drawings were a reflection of disturbing and dangerous fantasies. The discovery of this notebook only adds to the evidence of premeditation and planning in Tristyn’s murder, as it suggests a pattern of violent behavior and thoughts in Aiden’s mindset.

One of Aiden’s friends also told the police that the crime was “100% premeditated” by Aiden based on statements that he had made to them.

The Guilty Plea

The state attorney’s office led by R.J. Larizza charged Aiden with a first-degree murder charge on May 27, 2021. Aiden was slated to be tried as an adult.

The case was set for jury selection on February 6, 2023, only a month ago from the time of this writing, but Aiden surprised the court and the public by entering a guilty plea ahead of jury selection. He hasn’t been sentenced yet, but the death penalty is off of the table because he was a juvenile at the time of the crime.His sentencing hearing is scheduled in two weeks.

According to at least one fellow inmate, Aiden has threatened other inmates and bragged about stabbing Tristyn in the face.

Remembering Tristyn Bailey

On the one-year anniversary of Tristyn’s death, her family, friends, and members of the community held a vigil in her honor and memory.

The Bailey family isn’t letting Tristyn’s memory fade away. They want to honor her life and legacy through by promoting mental health among teenagers. It’s their way of ensuring that no other family has to go through the same tragedy they did.

To further pay tribute to Tristyn, the family is organizing awards in her name for her former cheerleading and lacrosse teams. It’s a beautiful way to acknowledge her hard work and dedication to these activities.

It’s an inspiring message to be sure. Through kindness, we can make the world a better place. Even in the darkest of times.

Hey, y’all. Today I have the tale of the Baton Rouge Serial Killer aka Derrick Todd Lee. Lee was a American serial killer who operated in the Baton Rouge area during the late 1990s and early 2000s, and during that time, he raped and killed seven women in the area. Let’s get into it.

Background
Derrick Todd Lee-The Baton Rouge Serial Killer
Derrick Todd Lee
Derrick Todd Lee was born on November 5, 1968, in St. Francisville, Louisiana. As one of four children, he unfortunately experienced physical abuse from his stepfather, which his mother turned a blind eye to. To make matters worse, he was also placed in special education classes and bullied by classmates.

In 1981, when he was just 13 years old, Lee found himself in hot water after burglarizing and vandalizing a candy store, and then he assaulted a woman in front of his mother on the same day. Three years later, he was suspected of murder but eventually released.

Lee even tried to cash in on his car insurance by setting his vehicle on fire. Unfortunately for Lee, the scheme went up in smoke (get it?).

Sometime in 1988, he met Jacqueline Denise Sims. They tied the knot the same year in Solitude, Louisiana. But the relationship was not sunshine and rainbows. Lee often beat Jacqueline and threatened her dad with a gun.

Before I jump into the full sequence of events I want to skip to the beginning of the end of Derrick Todd Lee’s killing spree.

In 2002, Derrick Todd Lee made the grave mistake of trying to assault Dianne Alexander. Derrick broke into her home and attempted to rape Dianne. But Dianne’s son was not having it and scared Lee off before he could finish his dirty work. Dianne’s son was even able to provide a description of Lee’s car to the police. And Dianne was able to provide police with a detailed description of Lee, which eventually led to his capture.

Victims/Timeline
In 1998, Lee escalated to serial murder and earned the moniker the Baton Rouge Serial Killer.

Known victims
April 18, 1998-Randi Mebruer
Randi Mebruer
Randi Mebruer
Randi Mebruer (28) was a home-health nurse who was last spotted at a local video store near her home in Zachary, Louisiana, in 1998. Randi and her son made it home from their video store trip, but later Randi’s son was found playing in the yard by a neighbor and he told the neighbor that his mother was “lost.”

Unfortunately, she hasn’t been seen since. There was blood and evidence of a struggle found in her home, leading investigators to believe that she was assaulted and her body taken elsewhere. In 2004, Derrick Todd Lee was linked to the crime scene through DNA and booked for her first-degree murder. Despite their efforts, the police have yet to locate any trace of Randi.

June 1, 1999-Collette Walker
Collette Walker, a resident of St. Francisville, Louisiana, pressed charges for stalking against Lee in June 1999, after he forcefully entered her home in an attempt to persuade her into a romantic relationship. Somehow, Collette was able to escort him out of her apartment. Derrick left her with his phone number and suggested that she contact him. A few days later, a neighbor informed Collette of a man suspiciously hanging around her residence, and she caught the peeping tom spying on her through her window. Collette contacted the authorities and then moved. I do not blame her one bit.

January 22, 2000-Consandra Green
Lee was charged with attempted first-degree murder for brutally kicking and stomping his girlfriend, Consandra Green, during an altercation at a bar over his inappropriate behavior towards another woman. He then attempted to escape from the authorities and reportedly tried to hit a sheriff’s deputy with a car. As a result, Lee was sentenced to two years in prison for the offense.

On January 14, 2002, Geralyn Barr DeSoto (21) was fatally stabbed and nearly decapitated at her residence near Highway 1 in Addis, Louisiana, situated on the opposite side of the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge. Her spouse, Darren, stumbled upon her lifeless body upon returning from work. Although he was the initial suspect in her killing, the inquiry eventually revealed DNA proof implicating Lee in the offense.

On May 31, 2002, Charlotte Murray Pace (22) was brutally raped and fatally stabbed in her Sharlo Avenue residence in Baton Rouge. Murray had recently relocated from Stanford Avenue, where Gina Wilson Green had met a similar fate. Murray had been stabbed 83 times with a flathead screwdriver. Charlotte had graduated with her MBA from LSU only days before her murder.

On November 21, 2002, Trineisha Dené Colomb (23) went missing from Grand Coteau, Louisiana, while visiting her mother’s grave. Three days later, a hunter found her lifeless body in a wooded area near Renaud Drive in Scott, Louisiana. She had been sexually assaulted and brutally beaten to death while she was still grieving the loss of her mother, who had passed away just seven months prior.

Carrie Lynn Yoder disappeared from her Baton Rouge home on Dodson Avenue on March 3, 2003, shortly after returning from a trip to New Orleans to celebrate Mardi Gras. Her body was found floating under the Whiskey Bay Bridge ten days later, and it was discovered that she had been subjected to sexual assault, physical abuse, and strangulation. Carrie was originally from Tampa, Florida and was a graduate student at LSU at the time of her murder.

Possible victims
August 1992-Connie Lynn Warner
Connie Lynn Warner (41) went missing from her home in Zachary, Louisiana in either August 23 or 24, 1992. She was found dead on Sorrel Street near Capitol Lake on September 2, 1992, near the state capitol building. Hurricane Andrew struck Baton Rouge on August 26, washing away all clues about the attacker. The investigation determined that Connie died due to a skull fracture caused by a beating.

June 13,1997-Eugenie Boisfontaine
Eugenie Boisfontaine (34) disappeared on June 13, 1997, from either her home on Stanford Avenue or while walking around LSU lakes. The next day, her credit cards were found arranged in a circle near the lakes by a visiting professor. She was found dead on August 7, submerged in Bayou Manchac near the Alligator Bayou Bar, with a skull fracture resulting from a brutal assault. It is suspected that Boisfontaine was one of Derrick Todd Lee’s victims, as she was close to his first victim on Stanford Avenue, although this has not been officially confirmed.

May 23, 2002-Christine Moore

Christine Moore
In May 2002, while jogging on River Road in Baton Rouge, Christine Moore (23) went missing, coincidentally close to the residence of Charlotte Murray Pace who was murdered a week later. Her remains were found on June 16 in a nearby ravine, close to the Ebenezer Baptist Church and several miles down River Road, where dogs were found scavenging. The cause of her death was identified as blunt force trauma leading to a skull fracture. Christine was studying for a master’s degree at LSU prior to her disappearance.

December 24, 2002-Mari Ann Fowler
Mari Ann Fowler
Mari Ann Fowler
Mari Ann Fowler (65) disappeared on Christmas Eve of 2002 from the parking lot of a Subway restaurant in Port Allen, Louisiana, and her body has never been found. She was the wife of a former commissioner of elections who was imprisoned at the time, and she bore a remarkable resemblance to Lynne Marino, the mother of Pam Kinamore. Mari Ann was on her way to visit her husband in prison when she vanished. Interestingly, about 20 minutes before her disappearance, Derrick Todd Lee’s cell phone signal was detected by a cell tower only 14 miles away from the location where she was last seen.

FBI Profile
When the FBI started connecting these murders, they brought in a profiler to work up a psychological description of the suspect. The profiler believed that the perpetrator must be a white man.

The Baton Rouge serial killer was initially profiled as an unfeeling white male, aged 25 to 35, who lived with others, displayed controlling tendencies and struggled with rejection. This perpetrator possessed a strong physique and held a job that required physical strength and minimal public interaction. Despite his self-perception as desirable to women, the killer’s social awkwardness around them revealed otherwise. He likely had an average or below-average socio-economic status with tight finances. The killer spent time studying his victims, typically making at least one attempt to interact with them before attacking. The thrill of taking risks suggested prior arrests for stalking and home intrusions.

If you’ve paid attention to the photos of Lee, you know that description is inaccurate since Lee is a black man. Did this profile slow down the investigation and result in more murders? It’s hard to say for sure, but it certainly didn’t help. I think that it’s likely that Lee’s voyeurism habits and criminal history would have thrown up more red flags for investigators if they weren’t focused on white men.

The investigation into the murders hit a wall, and the police were left scratching their heads. So, they went back to the drawing board and started testing the DNA of thousands of Caucasian men in the area. But this effort proved to be a wild goose chase, so they turned to DNAPrint Genomics for help. This now-defunct company analyzed the DNA evidence left at the crime scenes and made a breakthrough by generating an ancestry profile that revealed the perpetrator was 85% African.

This revelation breathed new life into the investigation and allowed the authorities to identify a black male suspect in the murder of Geralyn Barr DeSoto. With a more focused search, the investigators found DNA evidence under DeSoto’s fingernails that helped link Lee to the 21-year-old’s death in Addis, Louisiana. 

Sean Vincent Gillis
Sean Vincent Gillis
Also throwing a wrench into the investigators’ search for their killer, was the fact that another serial killer was active in the area at the same time as Lee.

Sean Vincent Gillis is an American serial killer and sex offender who tragically took the lives of eight Louisiana women between 1994 and 2004. He was arrested at his home in 2004 and charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Katherine Hall, Johnnie Mae Williams, and Donna Bennett Johnston. Shockingly, Gillis later confessed to these murders and revealed that he had also killed five additional women. Gillis’s first murder was of 82-year-old Ann Bryan in March 1994, and his final victim was Donna Bennett Johnston in 2004, whose body was found in a drainage canal. Gillis was sentenced to life in prison.

Justice
Derrick Todd Lee-The Baton Rouge Serial Killer
Derrick Todd Lee
In May 2003, investigators found a match to the DNA sample taken from 26-year-old Carrie Yoder, making Derrick Todd Lee the prime suspect in her murder and an eventual arrest warrant. Lee fled to Chicago, Illinois, and later Atlanta, Georgia with his family in an attempt to avoid facing the murder charges. He was ultimately apprehended by a joint FBI and metropolitan Atlanta police force squad in a local hotel and brought back to Louisiana, where authorities uncovered his extensive criminal record.

After a trial that lasted for three days in August 2004, Lee was found guilty by a jury for the first-degree murder of Geralyn DeSoto. The conviction resulted in an automatic life sentence.

In the trial for the murder of Charlotte Murray Pace, the district attorney pursued the death penalty for Lee if he was found guilty. The defense argued that Lee should not receive the death sentence as his IQ was between 62 and 65, which would classify him as mentally challenged and therefore exempt him from being sentenced to death.

But, the jury rejected this argument and sentenced Lee to death based on his past work experience and adequate decision-making. In December 2004, Lee was sentenced to death and placed on death row.

In a separate trial that took place three months later, another jury found Lee guilty of the first-degree murder of Pace, who was killed on May 31, 2002, and the attempted murder of Alexander, both of which were prosecuted by Sinquefield. During the trial, Sinquefield presented evidence from the other murders that helped persuade the jurors that Lee deserved the death penalty.

While still on death row, Lee passed away on January 21, 2016, before he could be executed. He was being held at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, Louisiana, where he had developed heart disease and received a pacemaker. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he eventually passed away.

Final thoughts
How confusing is it that there were two active serial killers in the same area at the same time? Adding the bad profile, it’s a miracle Lee was ever arrested. I hope that his convictions and eventual death brought some peace to his victims’ families.

Hey, y’all. Over the weekend, I received an Instagram request to delve into the perplexing case of Tiffany Valiante. If you like true crime (and, hi, if so), this case may ring a bell as it was featured in the first episode of Volume 3 of the Netflix show Unsolved Mysteries, which is a modern reboot of the classic show. The show is a contemporary revival of the classic series and I bet the theme song is stuck in your head now. I had to refresh my memory on the case, so I rewatched the episode, which features the death of 18-year-old Tiffany Valianted who was hit by a speeding train. The question remains, did Tiffany Valiante take her own life or was she the victim of murder?

Who was Tiffany Valiante?
Tiffany Valiante
Tiffany Valiante
Tiffany Valiante was born on March 3, 1997, to her parents Dianne Valiante and Stephen Valiante. She had recently graduated from Oakcrest High School in her hometown of Mays Landing, New Jersey.

Tiffany was well-known for being super smart, friendly, and hardworking. Not only did she crush it in school, but she was also a total boss on the volleyball court. Standing tall at 6’3″, she was a powerful force you just couldn’t ignore. People couldn’t help but be amazed and respect her awesome skills on the court.

Tiffany had ambitious goals for her future. She received a volleyball scholarship to Mercy College, where she intended to excel on the volleyball court and outperform her competitors. She planned to major in criminal justice and aspired to play volleyball in the U.S. Olympics. In addition to her athletic pursuits, Tiffany was considering her career options, such as joining the Air Force or working in law enforcement.

What happened on July 12, 2015?

Steve, Tiffany, and Dianne Valiante
On the evening of July 12, 2015, the Valiante family was enjoying a graduation party for one of Tiffany’s cousins near their home in Mays Landing. However, things took a bad turn when a friend of Tiffany’s informed her parents, Dianne and Steve, that Tiffany had used her debit card to purchase clothes and food without permission. Tiffany’s parents went home and confronted her, which led to a big argument between Tiffany and her mom. Upset, Tiffany stormed off.

It wasn’t mentioned in the Unsolved Mysteries episode, but before Tiffany left, her mother saw her put the disputed debit card in her back pocket. Additionally, it was not mentioned that Tiffany had been caught taking money from her parents’ bank account a few months earlier.

Dianne tried to find Tiffany’s dad to talk about the debit card problem, but when her parents came back to the driveway, Tiffany had disappeared.

Around 9:30pm, after the argument with her mother, a deer camera in the Valiante property captured Tiffany striding down her driveway and into darkness. This was odd because everyone knew Tiffany was afraid of the dark.

It didn’t take long for her parents to realize that their daughter was nowhere to be found. They frantically called and sent text messages to her cell phone, hoping for a response, but they never received a response. To their horror, Tiffany’s trusty phone was discovered lying on the grass in front of her home, a sure sign that something was amiss. After all, what teenage girl goes anywhere without her cell phone?

Tiffany was dressed for a summer day in a casual ensemble of a t-shirt, white shorts, flat shoes, and a white headband. She was even caught on camera holding her cell phone. 

I’m sure Tiffany’s parents were hoping for the best, but unfortunately, the truth was the worst. 

Sadly, Tiffany’s life was cut short by a tragedy, as she was struck by a New Jersey Transit train four miles away from her last known location. Her body was found on the train tracks not far from the Valiante home near mile marker 45.

The autopsy report detailed the gruesome aftermath of Tiffany being hit by a train, listing the cause of death as “multiple traumatic injuries.” Tiffany’s limbs were ripped from her torso, her face and head were crushed beyond recognition, and her brain had “extruded from the cranial cavity.” To make matters worse, Tiffany’s torso was found clad only in underwear and her shoes were missing from the scene.

Investigation

By the next morning, the New Jersey Transit Police had already declared Tiffany’s death a suicide. That didn’t take long.

Marvin Olivares, a student engineer, was at the control of the NJ Transit train that fateful night. As he pushed the accelerator and the train picked up speed, his supervising engineer, Wayne Daniels, hopped out of the cab to have a quick chat with the conductor up ahead.

However, in a split second, Olivares had to blow the horn, put the train into emergency, and tragically announced that a girl had jumped in front of the train.

Tiffany was hit by the train at 11:07 pm and was unfortunately dragged and cut up for a good quarter-mile before the train finally stopped.

The inconsistencies in Olivares and Daniels’ statements have long been a source of frustration for the Valiante family’s attorney Paul d’Amato, who filed a civil suit against NJ Transit. In the lawsuit, he pointed out that Olivares provided different versions of events each time he was questioned by investigators, while Daniels also gave conflicting accounts of what happened that night.

To make matters worse, the evidence in Tiffany’s case was not handled properly, leading to evidence being lost or contaminated and making it useless for further DNA testing.

According to the medical examiner’s office, Tiffany’s toxicology report was clean. However, the perplexing part is the lack of a rape kit examination. It’s not quite clear why this was skipped, but it appears that NJ Transit jumped to the conclusion of suicide and only considered evidence that aligned with that theory.

As I mentioned before, the toxicology report indicated that there were no traces of alcohol or drugs in her system, which is unusual in cases of suicide. Plus, a psychological autopsy, which is a method used to assess a person’s mental state and determine whether they were at risk of suicide, was not conducted.

A few weeks after Tiffany’s death, her mom Dianne stumbled upon her shoes and headband over a mile away from the train crash site. What was Tiffany doing, going for a scenic stroll through the woods before deciding to take on a speeding locomotive? That’s just not adding up in my book.

Theories & evidence
Tiffany Valiante
Tiffany Valiante
So now we’ve got the official conclusion and the bare-bones facts, but it’s time to get speculative. We’re going to explore the three potential scenarios for how things went down. Are you ready to play detective with me?

Accident
Let’s start with the least likely explanation: an accident. Frankly, I find it hard to believe that Tiffany’s tragic demise was just a series of unfortunate events. I mean, what are the chances that she had a heated argument about debit card theft and then oops-a-daisy accidentally walks right into the path of a train?

As far as I know, she wasn’t wearing any earbuds, so she should have been able to hear that locomotive rumbling toward her. Plus, it was nighttime, so that train’s light would have been as clear as day. Sorry, but I’m chucking this theory into the garbage bin of implausibility.

Suicide
Now, let’s turn to the official conclusion in Tiffany’s demise. NJ Transit Police ruled her death a suicide. But here’s the catch, they didn’t really have any solid evidence to back up this claim.

The only reason offered for suicide is that she had recently broken up with her girlfriend. But according to everyone who knew the couple, their split was amicable. Tiffany was actually already seeing another woman.

So, why did the police label it as a suicide then? My guess is that they simply took the easy way out and conveniently blamed it on suicide, so they wouldn’t have to take any responsibility for her passing. Classic move, right?

 
Murder
Obviously, the Valiante family doesn’t agree with suicide being Tiffany’s cause of death. And honestly, who can blame them? There are plenty of reasons to doubt the New Jersey Transit Police’s verdict, not to mention some pretty damning pieces of evidence that don’t quite add up.

Botched investigation
Unfortunately, there’s not much forensic evidence to go on, thanks in part to the New Jersey Transit Police’s lack of experience in investigating suspicious deaths. To make matters worse, Tiffany’s family had her remains cremated before realizing that proper procedures weren’t followed during the initial investigation.

I mean, come on, why wouldn’t the investigators check for sexual assault with a rape kit when the victim is only in their underwear? Talk about a procedural oversight! And don’t get me started on the medical examiner’s report – it’s chock full of inconsistencies. It’s no wonder this case has left everyone scratching their heads.

Retired medical examiner H. Louise Houseman, who was brought in as an independent expert to assess the original investigation, discovered a bunch of weird inconsistencies in the case. Like, how can you use the word ‘cut’ in the medical report when no autopsy was performed? It’s almost like the investigators were trying to pull a fast one.

And get this, there was even an ax with red markings found near the scene that could have been linked to Tiffany Valiante, but it was lost before it could be tested. I mean, who loses an ax at a crime scene?


According to the crime scene photos, there was a massive puddle of blood where Tiffany was found, indicating that she might have been bleeding out before getting hit by the train. Though they never confirmed if it was her blood or if it was enough to knock her lights out, this bizarre piece of evidence, coupled with other facts, suggests that someone might have murdered her.

Tiffany’s shoes were found a mile away from where she was found, but her feet didn’t show any signs of traipsing through the wilderness or on rough terrain. That’s a bit bizarre, don’t you think?

The cell phone
When it comes to Tiffany’s disappearance, there’s a pretty solid piece of circumstantial evidence that she may have been snatched up into a motor vehicle against her will. How do we know this, you ask?

Well, her phone was discovered on the ground, and Tiffany was never without that thing. Her dad found the phone about five to eight feet off the side of the road in front of their house. Tiffany was so attached to it that she even had a waterproof case to keep it safe while she showered. So the fact that she would just drop it and not notice is pretty darn unlikely.

Rumors
With the help of some private investigators, D’Amato (the Valiante’s attorney) uncovered a local store manager who had a juicy tip: teenage employees were gossiping about how Valiante was abducted and forced onto the train tracks.

They even suggested her friend, who used her debit card after her death, might have been involved. But when the cops got involved, the teens suddenly clammed up and claimed they never said any of that, insisting it was a suicide.

Final Thoughts
Tiffany Valiante
Tiffany Valiante
Questions still loom large in the case of Tiffany Valiante: why would Tiffany choose to walk that far to take her own life? And why would she take off her clothes and shoes beforehand? The missing shorts don’t help the case either. And perhaps most baffling of all, why would a girl who never expressed suicidal thoughts suddenly jump in front of a train?

As with many true crime cases, we may never know the full story. However, the Valiante family continues to seek justice for their daughter, and the memory of Tiffany Valiante will never be forgotten.

Understandably, Tiffany’s family is unwilling to accept that their loved one killed herself, and I can understand why they feel that way in light of all of the evidence to the contrary. There is a change.org petition asking the New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin to reopen the investigation.

Tiffany’s family and friends refuse to write her death off an unsolved mystery, let alone give up. They’ll persist until there’s #JusticeForTiffany. 

Hey, y’all. This week, I have the story of the abduction, sexual assault, and eventual murder of 16-year-old Leesa Marie Gray. Leesa was killed on June 22, 2000, by Thomas Edwin Loden, Jr., a former Marine who was then working as a recruiter. This is the story of a thirty-something-year-old man who hit on a 16-year-old and then murdered her after she spurned his advances. I think of cases like this when someone inevitably tells a woman who was raped that she should have said no. When you say no, sometimes you end up dead.

In 2000, Leesa was 16-years-old and was about to start her senior year at Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton, Mississippi, and she was eager to start the next chapter of her life. During her senior year, she was an active member of the school chorus and participated in several school events.

Leesa was also a devout Christian and actively involved in her church youth group at Bethel Baptist Church. She looked forward to attending the weekly meetings and spending time with her friends and fellow church members.

Leesa was particularly close with her mom, Wanda Farris, who was always there for her when she needed her.

It was the summer before her senior year and Leesa was excited about her plans for the future. She was preparing for college to become an elementary school teacher.

Leesa’s best friend Lisa Darracott was always by her side, providing her with support and encouragement. Together they enjoyed listening to the Spice Girls and dancing to their favorite tunes.

I know it’s cliche, but from what I’ve read, Leesa was a good kid who had a happy future ahead of her.


Where’s Leesa?
It was Friday, June 22, 2000, and Leesa had just finished her shift at her uncle’s restaurant, Comer’s, around 11 p.m. She was on the mile-long drive to her home when she realized she had a flat tire while on a rural road. She stopped to inspect the tire, but it was dark and she was alone.

When Leesa didn’t arrive home, her mother became worried and called Comer’s Restaurant to see if anyone had seen her. One of the cooks informed her that he had seen a car on the side of the road with its flashers on during his drive to work.

Leesa’s family members soon located the car and found that it was unlocked with the flashers still on. Her purse and cell phone were inside the car, but there was no sign of the teenager.

Leesa’s mother immediately called the police, and a search for Leesa Marie Gray began.

Investigation

The police investigation into Leesa’s disappearance began by interviewing her coworkers and patrons of Comer’s restaurant. And one person stood out: Thomas Edwin “Eddie” Loden, Jr. He had been to the restaurant twice on the Friday that Leesa vanished.

According to interviews, Eddie Loden had actually made an advance toward Leesa, which Leesa flatly rejected.

Oh, have I mentioned that Eddie was 35 years old? Because he was. Eddie was a former Marine who served during Desert Storm and now recruits for the Marine Corps. Yeah. Creepy.

Eddie was from a respected family in the area and had a wife and a two-year-old.

After learning about Eddie’s weird behavior with a teenage girl on the day of her disappearance, law enforcement paid Eddie’s grandmother a visit who gave them permission to search her home.

Apparently, Eddie had a room in the home. I don’t think he was living there but he had previously and still had his own bedroom. Eddie’s grandmother said that he was fishing at a pond on the large property.

But, anyway, investigators find a pair of shorts with blood on them, and in the grandmother’s car, they found rope. At this point, the cops obtained a search warrant to seize a green van that belonged to Eddie.

However, Eddie was nowhere to be found. That is until he’s found on the side of the road less than 24 hours after the last sighting of Leesa with the words “I’m sorry,” carved into his chest. He had also cut his wrists, so he was rushed to Mississippi State hospital for treatment.

Discovery of Leesa’s body and videotape

The day after Leesa went missing, her body was unfortunately discovered under the backseat of Eddie’s van. She was nude, and an autopsy revealed that the cause of death was suffocation and strangulation.

But the investigators also found a video camera and after taking it to the station, they watched the tape, which showed Eddie torturing, sexually assaulting, and strangling Leesa. The last clip on the tape is of her dead body, which Eddie was still violating.

That’s all the detail I really want to go into here, but I will also note that Thomas isn’t seen on tape but you can hear his voice as he taunts Leesa about being a virgin. And the tape indicates that the attack lasted four hours.

Thomas’s face was not visible in the video evidence, but his voice could be heard clearly. The authorities found his minivan and an object that Eddie used to sexually assault Leesa with his DNA on it. After Thomas was released from the hospital, he was taken into custody and the police searched his grandmother’s house, where they discovered a freshly dug grave in the forest with a shovel nearby.

Thomas’s wife visited him while he was in custody, and it was after this visit that he decided to confess to the sexual assault, although initially denied killing Leesa.

 
Why?
Thomas Edwin Loden, Jr. 
Thomas Edwin Loden, Jr.
The motive behind Eddie’s violent crime seems to stem from his unrequited crush on Leesa. After she rejected his advances, it appears that he may have premeditated the murder because an object pierced Leesa’s tire at the restaurant that night. Did Eddie stab her tire to set the flat tire up? I think he did.

But Eddie claims that he was just trying to do a good deed until Leesa told him she had no interest in joining the Marines. That made him irate. He then forced her into his van and drove to his grandmother’s house where he tortured Leesa for four hours.

I personally think the unrequited romance is a more likely motive. It appears to me that the Marines excuse was made up by Eddie to justify his actions and potentially gain sympathy as a veteran.

But that didn’t work because Eddie was arrested and charged with capital murder, rape, and four counts of sexual battery.

Litigation (Plea deal, sentence, appeals)

When it came to Eddie’s trial, due to the high public attention and both families being well-known in the community, the judge granted a change of venue. Three weeks before the scheduled trial, Eddie took a guilty plea for all charges instead of waiting for a jury trial, even though it was a death penalty case. Despite being questioned about his decision, Thomas confirmed that he understood and wanted to proceed to sentencing.

During the sentencing, Eddie’s defense attorney did not cross-examine witnesses or object to anything, which puzzled the judge. The prosecution presented plenty of aggravating evidence, including a video recording of sexual torture.

When it was time for the defense to present mitigating evidence, the defense attorney stated that Thomas had instructed them not to present any evidence, but to protect himself, he shared information that could potentially be considered mitigating evidence.

The defense counsel informed the judge that Thomas had a history of childhood sexual abuse, was a great student, an honorably discharged Marine who served during Desert Storm, and had no criminal record. The defense also provided a summary of expert witness Dr. C. Gerald O’Brien who could testify that Thomas was suffering from extreme mental and emotional disturbance during the commission of the crime and could not appreciate the nature of it.

The prosecution countered by introducing their own expert witness who stated that Thomas could appreciate the nature of the crime. The prosecution asked for the death penalty, which was granted by the judge. Thomas eventually made a statement to the court expressing remorse and asking for justice for the victim’s family.

Thomas was sentenced to death for the first charge and 30 consecutive years for the remaining offenses. After his sentence, Thomas tried to file appeals, including a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, but all were denied.

21 years after being on death row, Thomas was executed by the state of Mississippi on December 14, 2022, by lethal injection. But not before enjoying a last meal of fried pork chops, a baked sweet potato, and peach cobbler with french vanilla ice cream.

Final Thoughts

I truly hope that Leesa’s family found a feeling of justice from Loden’s execution.

Leesa’s mother says that she has forgiven Eddie and has found peace in her life. But while she has forgiven Eddie, she will never forget Leesa.

Hey, y’all. Last week was crazy busy for me and I couldn’t find the time to recap last week’s episode of Dateline, but I’m back, baby. And this week, we get Keith Morrison who tells the story of Lloyd Barrus and the deadly chase that claimed the life of a police officer in Dateline On a Dark, Deserted Highway.

High-speed chase
In May 2017, a small-town Montana deputy was cruising home after a quiet shift. Spring was in the air and the deputy was looking forward to going home early. Then suddenly, a speeding Chevy Suburban flew by and the deputy gave chase. 

However, when the deputy stopped answering his calls, the reason became apparent. The deputy was found with his car door open at mile marker 109, and EMTs were called for medical assistance.

This incident led to one of the most furious chases in Montana’s history, with speeds reaching 140 miles an hour. The driver of the Chevy Suburban, Lloyd Barrus, became one of the most notorious criminals in Montana’s history. 

But according to Keith, the story of Lloyd Barrus began long before this night on the highway. It started over 50 years ago in McCammon, Idaho, where he met Michael Cobia in high school. The two became fast friends and got involved in unwholesome activities until Lloyd found religion and got Mike back on the right path.

He went on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and married his girlfriend Tracy when he returned from the mission.

Tracy

Tracy says that Lloyd was a good provider, a God-fearing man, and a proud father of two boys (Marshall and Jeffrey). However, Lloyd made it clear to Tracy that she was to submit to him as his wife and that he was the arbiter of right and wrong. Oh, he was one of *those* religious people.

Tracy tells Keith that back then, people didn’t talk about abuse and domestic violence and that’s such a sad reality of how the world once was. We’ve come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.

So how did this man who was strong in his LDS faith go from missionary to monster?

Tracy began to realize that Lloyd was involved in something secret, and the phone calls from people she didn’t know only reinforced her suspicions. Lloyd would often return from these mysterious trips and rant like a 19th-century prophet about the government’s role in our lives. Meanwhile, Tracy lived in fear of his sudden flashes of anger and violence.

And Lloyd was paranoid, often raving about the government.

At her wit’s end, Tracy went to her LDS Bishop, but he only made the situation worse by suggesting that she was just having a hormonal mood swing. Marriage was considered sacred in their community, and the bishop reminded them that they should keep trying. However, things only got worse, and Tracy was subjected to marital rape and other forms of abuse.

Eventually, Tracy filed for divorce, and after it was granted, Lloyd essentially kidnapped his sons from a sitter and took them 700 miles away to Tacoma, Washington.

Debra

While Lloyd’s first wife, Tracy, was frantically searching for her two sons, Lloyd had settled in at a new church and caught the eye of some of the women there. That’s where he met Debra, a divorced mother of two. Debra had no idea about Lloyd’s past, married him, and took on the role of a mother to Marshall and Jeffrey.

At some point, Lloyd took his new family to Alaska. Debra soon became pregnant with a son of her own, Alma, and the family continued to grow.

Once in Alaska, Lloyd continued his slide into paranoia and extremism. As time went on, Lloyd became increasingly secretive and stopped attending his LDS ward. He became involved with a neighbor who was also against the government, and they began thumbing their noses at local ordinances and refusing to pay taxes. Lloyd’s allegiance to the church was changing and he was now a fanatical Amway distributor, calling himself Diamond Lloyd Barrus.

However, when Lloyd’s Amway distributorship failed, he became angry and abusive towards Debra, once forcing her to hold a fake smile in front of her face all night long so that she would know how to behave.

Debra’s escape
Years later, Lloyd agreed to let the boys visit Tracy, but with a warning that he would come with a gun if there were any funny business. Tracy consulted a child psychologist who advised her against kidnapping the boys back.

She sent the boys back to Lloyd but had no idea of the danger they were in. Lloyd was constantly armed, with a closet full of weapons, and was practicing fight moves in front of the mirror.

One day, Lloyd shot and killed a neighbor’s black lab puppy, and Debra realized that Lloyd was becoming more and more dangerous. She devised a plan to escape, and one night when Lloyd announced that he had to work all night, she gathered her children and left. Debra and her children went straight to a domestic violence shelter in Anchorage and called her LDS bishop, who went to the airport in disguise to purchase airplane tickets for them.

Unfortunately, Debra left Marshall and Jeffrey with Lloyd because she wasn’t their mother and had no legal right to remove them.

Debra tells Keith about her fear and the lengths she went to in order to escape Lloyd’s abuse and track. She first fled to Arizona and then to Washington where her parents lived, but even with a change of location, Lloyd was able to track her down.

Debra was forced to act in self-defense when Lloyd appeared on her doorstep, armed with a knife and a gun. She managed to convince him to take a walk with her, and it was only through a lucky coincidence that a visitor arrived, allowing Debra to escape the immediate danger.

For Debra, this was only the beginning of an odyssey to keep her and her family safe. She was forced to move from place to place, constantly in fear of Lloyd’s ability to track her down. But even years later, she still lived in fear of him.

He shot down a helicopter?
Dateline On a Dark, Deserted Highway
In 1999, Lloyd Barrus was living in Idaho with a new girlfriend and was upset with the government for various reasons. By now, he had been through three wives, had ten children, and told his childhood friend, Michael Cobia, that it was all the government’s fault.

Lloyd also refused to pay child support and lost all of his professional licenses. In March of 2000, he was summoned to an Idaho court on DUI and other charges but skipped town instead with his girlfriend and his now 20-year-old son Jeffrey.

In the early morning on the way to Las Vegas, Lloyd and his group were pulled over by a highway patrolman. When the officer approached the car, he found Lloyd with a shotgun and Lloyd told him he could have as many weapons as he wanted.

The cop tried to call for backup but the nearest officer was 18 miles away. Jeffrey tried to lure the police officer back to the car, but he stayed out of sight and waited for backup. When backup arrived, they attempted a high-risk stop, but the car fled. The chase led to Death Valley where Jeffrey, Lloyd, and the woman bailed out of the car, grabbing several firearms and digging a makeshift bunker.

The standoff went on for 18 hours, with some of the cops reporting gunfire and moans coming from the bunker. Eventually, the helicopter sent to monitor the situation was shot down by Jeffrey, but the crew miraculously survived. The standoff ended when the three suspects surrendered and were arrested by the law officers who had surrounded them.

Turns out, that was the first time anyone had ever shot down a chopper, which is impressive, I guess? Jeffrey and Lloyd were taken into custody and interviewed.

I tried to transcribe what Lloyd said, but honestly, his interview made no sense. He rambles about how he hated the government and had written a letter to former President George W. Bush.

But the important thing to take away here is that he immediately turned on his son Jeffrey, blaming him for everything. Lloyd took a plea deal and was sentenced to ten years less prison time than Jeffrey.

After being released from prison, Lloyd moved to Bakersfield and reemerged on social media, documenting his life and beliefs. He made predictions of an imminent military coup, fevered allegations of government genocide campaigns, and posted photos of lynchings. His son Alma was alarmed and tried to stop him but was unable to find any help from law enforcement. Lloyd eventually pointed his car north towards Montana, driven by his dark fantasies.

The shootout
Dateline On a Dark, Deserted Highway
In May 2017, Lloyd Barrus was newly paroled in California and traveled to Montana to visit his firstborn son, Marshall. Marshall had been no doubt traumatized by his dad raising him as a soldier, but he was determined to turn his life around and start anew with his family.

However, a camping trip near Canyon Ferry Lake in Montana’s Broadwater County took a turn for the worse when Lloyd and Marshall started drinking and things escalated. Marshall cut off his ankle bracelet and started shooting his semi-automatic weapon.

Shortly after 2:30 a.m. on May 16, 2017, Deputy Mason Moore spotted a white Suburban speeding past a gas station called The Town Pump, which is a great name.

But now, let’s learn about Deputy Mason Moore, who would later be killed by Marshall and Lloyd.

Deputy Mason Moore, Dateline On a Dark, Deserted Highway
Deputy Mason Moore
Deputy Mason Moore was known for his South Carolina accent and his college sweetheart-turned-wife, Jodi Moore. The couple eventually moved to Montana in 2011. Mason always said that he knew he was destined to be a cop.

Mason fit in well at the Broadwater County Sheriff’s Office, where he was considered a big brother to dispatcher Kylie Howard. Despite his Southern accent, which was hard to understand at first over the radio, Kylie and Mason made a great team.

On Monday, May 15th, while Mason was starting his shift in the afternoon, Jodi recalls kissing him goodbye as she was leaving the house to pick up their daughter from school. It was a normal, busy day for the couple.

That evening at the Broadwater County Sheriff’s Office, the phones were dead and it was a very quiet night, which was unusual for law enforcement.

At 2:00 AM, Deputy Moore made his final rounds and he always checked the main businesses before leaving. It was a quiet night, but things changed quickly. At 2:13 AM, security footage shows a white Suburban parked at a gas station called the Town Pump.

Just a few minutes later, Deputy Moore passed the same gas station and turned onto the highway. As he was driving, the Suburban passed him again, going way too fast. Deputy Moore radioed in the license plate, but little did he know that this would be his final call.

Six minutes after the incident, the suburban passed the same camera, heading in the same direction as the deputy. On a dark stretch of highway, Deputy Moore’s dash cam shows the Suburban passing his patrol car. Tragically, this was the last time Deputy Moore was seen alive.

A chase ensued and Deputy Moore followed Lloyd and Marshall at dangerous speeds, up to at least 146 miles per hour.


Backup arrived to help after Deputy Moore stopped responding via his radio. The police dropped spike strips, but the SUV just kept driving on rims.

Then the cops saw someone (it’s unclear if that was Lloyd or Marshall) take a sniper position in the back of the Suburban. The sniper opened fire on the police but by now the backup that Deputy Moore had called for arrived.

A shootout followed and only ended when Marshall was dead.

Deputy Moore’s body was found later that morning. Despite the efforts of the police officers to save his life, Marshall did not survive his wounds. Lloyd Barrus, Marshall’s father, was taken into custody after the shooting.

The trial
Lloyd Barrus, Dateline On a Dark, Deserted Highway
Lloyd Barrus
During his time in jail, Lloyd was interviewed by reporters and shared his views on the situation. He considered himself an extreme believer in the Constitution and had no remorse for the death of Deputy Moore.

Jodi Moore, the wife of the deceased Deputy, remembered the moment she found out about her husband’s death as a moment of shock and anger. She felt that she had let him down and was overwhelmed by the responsibility of picking out a casket for him.

The funeral service was a difficult time for the family, with Jodi feeling out of place and disconnected from reality. After the service, Mason’s body was taken to South Carolina where he was buried in the family plot.

Lloyd Barrus was known for talking at length about his beliefs and his self-introduction to the police. He considered himself an “oath keeper” and believed that he was being persecuted for his political views. In the end, Lloyd never showed any remorse for the death of Deputy Moore.

Montana is one of the few states with a long and fabled history with the hangman’s noose, but no judge has implemented the death penalty in the 21st century. . In the case of Lloyd Barrus, who begged to be executed after his arrest, the Broadwater County attorney filed the intent to seek the death penalty.

The decision was made due to the crime committed, which was the killing of a law enforcement officer in an ambush. The officer’s widow, Jodi Moore, believed that the crime warranted the death penalty.

However, due to Lloyd Barrus’s diagnosed mental illnesses, including severe paranoid personality disorder and delusional disorder, a judge found him incompetent to stand trial. He was sent to a state psychiatric facility for treatment.

Lloyd refused to take the drugs that might restore him to competency, but the state of Montana was eventually able to force him to take antipsychotic medication after the Montana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state.

In September 2021, Lloyd’s trial began, with prosecutors quoting his own words where he stated that he would accept death and wished to be executed.

For some reason, the judge excluded information about Lloyd’s past, including the California shootout and his inculcation of his children into extremism. The prosecutors instead focused on the events leading up to the death of Deputy Moore and were able to call Lloyd’s granddaughter as a witness.

The prosecutors played tapes of Lloyd and Marshall waiting at a gas station for a deputy to drive by and then shooting him. The tapes also showed Deputy Moore struggling for breath after being shot, but unable to speak. The trial was emotional and difficult to listen to, as the prosecutors presented the evidence to the jury.

Sentencing
Lloyd Barrus was sentenced for his part in the murder of Deputy Mason Moore at the Broadwater County Courthouse in Townsend, Montana. Lloyd had a chance to avoid prison and spend his days in a state psychiatric hospital if he could convince a judge that he couldn’t appreciate the criminality of his offense nor comport his behavior to the law. However, the attorney general’s office argued that Barrus should go to prison without the possibility of parole.

On sentencing day, Jodi Moore and her twin sons, who had gone through high school during the legal battle, faced Barrus in the courtroom. Mason’s brothers and sisters in law enforcement also spoke in court, calling for Barrus to be locked away from society forever.

Jodi Moore, who had put in many sleepless nights and tears into her statement, addressed Barrus, expressing her disbelief at the lack of remorse in his eyes.

Jodi’s powerful statement was punctuated by a letter from Mason, who had tucked away a note for Jodi in case something were to happen to him. In the letter, Mason told Jodi not to dwell on his death and to enjoy life.

Jodi and Mason Moore
Legacy
In a Montana courtroom, the fate of Lloyd Barrus was decided. Despite his government-paid attorneys fighting to keep him out of prison, the judge sentenced Barrus to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The sentence was a relief for the officers who captured Barrus. It was also a relief for those affected by Barrus’ crimes, including his second wife Debra, who had fled from his abuse, and his son Alma, who wrote an open letter apologizing for his father’s actions.

For Jodi Moore, the loss of her husband led her to stay in Montana and open a bookstore called “Book Therapy and More.” The bookstore is also the headquarters for the Mason Moore Foundation, a charity Jodi founded to raise money for safety equipment for cops. The motto of the foundation is “Love wins,” a message that Mason shared with Jodi before his death.

Hey, y’all. Today I have the story of the 2015 murders of most of the Bever family in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, by teenage brothers Robert and Michael Bever. I feel like I say this every time I do a case deep dive, but, whew, this one is a doozy. Adolescent killers freak me out way more than most adult murderers. Let’s get into it.

David Bever
Recluses
The Bever family were essentially recluses. The family would avoid the neighbors and rarely spoke to anyone outside of the family. Some of the neighbors didn’t even know all of the family members’ names until after the murders.

David, the father, worked in IT, and it seems like the mother April worked odd jobs and also worked as a stay-at-home mom.

Homeschooling
Can you guess how the kids were educated? That’s right-they were home-schooled. Homeschooling isn’t necessarily harmful in and of itself, but it definitely served to isolate the Bever children.

And I think if you do choose to homeschool, you need to make an effort to socialize your children. April and David Bever didn’t do that. The kids were only allowed to play with each other. They weren’t in any clubs or on any sporting teams. They did attend church, but I wasn’t able to find out exactly what denomination it was.

Robert who is the oldest child was the only one to ever attend a public school, but he was allegedly molested, and that’s why they pulled him out and stuck to homeschooling. I can’t confirm that this happened, but I wouldn’t be surprised.

Abuse?
If you’re picking up a creepy vibe from this family, you aren’t alone. According to Michael, David was physically and emotionally abusive with the children. There’s no evidence to support this, but the oldest daughter Crystal corroborated this claim.

Whether David and April were actually abusive I can’t say for sure. But they certainly hated the world outside their home and would tell their children that the apocalypse would be a fair reward to the world. And in my opinion, isolation alone can be considered abuse.

Not only was the family deeply reclusive, but David was also a security nut. Or at least that’s what he said. He had cameras installed in every room in the house. That speaks of a man who wants to be in control all of the time.

Robert and Michael
The big, bad internet

This doesn’t make much sense to me, but the kids had basically unlimited access to the internet. Weird considering how much the rest of their lives were controlled.

Robert was an aspiring YouTuber and his channel is still live if you want to check it out. His YouTube channel is mostly blogs that didn’t get a lot of views at the time of the murders.

Both Robert and Michael were online often. And wouldn’t you be if you couldn’t speak to other people? I mean I’m always online and I have plenty of people to speak to.

Serial killers
Eventually, Robert developed a fascination with serial killers and school shootings. Of particular interest to him were the Columbine school shooting and the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting.

Robert later got his younger brother Michael interested in mass killings also. They would stay up all hours of the night in their shared bedroom discussing the details of the killings.

And I don’t mean the kind of fascination that you and I have. Robert was obsessed with gaining infamy for mass murder. He said that he wanted his own Wikipedia page and he got it.

Rampage

So you have the two eldest brothers becoming more and more isolated even from their own family and becoming more and more obsessed with killers. This can’t end well.

At some point, Robert and Michael watched the 2009 film Rampage. I had never heard of this movie but a quick read of its IMDB page, fits right in with Robert and Micheal’s increasingly dangerous obsessions.

The TLDR version of the plot is that a young man who lives with his parents and works a dead-end job builds his own Kevlar body armor and goes on rampage (get it?) through his town killing 93 people. His motives were population reduction I think? I’m not really clear on that.

The plan

Put all of these ingredients together put it in the oven at 350 and in 20 minutes, you will have dangerous teenage boys with a lust for violence and murder. Follow me for more recipes.

Robert and Micheal decided that they wanted to join the ranks of their favorite mass murderers. They really wanted that Wikipedia page.

So, their goal was to kill at least 50 people across the country ending in Washington state. They planned to randomly stop and kill ten people at each stop. Robert kept detailed notes of this plan in a notebook in their bedroom.

How were they going to fund this murderganza? Well, Robert got a job at a *checks notes* Christian call center. I guess people would call with prayer requests. Robert saved up enough money to buy body armor, bulletproof helmets, knives, guns, and ammunition.

The oldest Bever daughter Crystal actually saw their knife collection once and it frightened her. She reported it to their parents who basically said, “Boys will be boys.”

The brothers were expecting a large shipment of ammunition to be delivered at their home on July 23, 2015. And they couldn’t let their parents find out about their plans.

true crime merch
The murders

That brings us to the murders that occurred on July 22, 2015. Because of the ammunition delivery the next day, Robert and Michael felt like they had no choice but to start their murder spree at their own home. The boys planned to film two different videos of the murders. One that was graphic and only for police and one that wasn’t graphic that I guess they planned to put on YouTube after they escaped.

Part one of the plan was to silently kill their family like ninjas. Part two was to dismember their bodies and put them in plastic bins in the attic before taking the family car and hitting the road.

So, that night, the two brothers waited until 11:30 p.m. when some of the family was asleep. April, the mother, asked Crystal to go get Robert and Michael to help her clean up for the night. But when Crystal opened the door to the boys’ bedroom, Robert and Michael were in their body armor with their knife collection spread out on the bed.

They then told Crystal they had something to show her on their computer. While she was distracted, Robert cut her throat from behind while Crystal struggled and fought. He also stabbed her in her torso and arms. But Crystal didn’t die quickly the way the boys thought would happen. She managed to run out of the room all the way onto the front yard and scream for help. She passed out in the yard.

Meanwhile, April heard the noise and saw Crystal covered in blood. Robert who was chasing Crystal, crossed paths with his mother and he stabbed her at least 48 times. After dispatching his mother, Robert told Michael to go bring Crystal back into the house so that the neighbors wouldn’t be alerted. He drug her back inside and left her in the doorway. They thought that she was dead. But she wasn’t. And she had woken up. Crystal did the smartest thing she could have and pretended to be dead.

After this, the brothers went from room to room hunting down their family members and stabbing them.

What happened next is among the more disturbing things I’ve ever read about or seen

Seven-year-old Christopher and five-year-old Victoria were hiding in a bathroom, and Michael lured Christopher and Victoria out by pretending to also be a victim of Robert. That will make your stomach turn.

If you’re keeping count, the only people still alive in the house besides Robert and Michael are 12-year-old Daniel, two-year-old Autumn, and Crystal though the brothers think that Crystal is dead.

Daniel somehow locked himself in a room and called 911. He told the dispatcher that his brothers were attacking the family. Michael convinced Daniel to let him into the room by pretending that he was also afraid and being attacked, just like he had done with Christopher and Victoria. He begged Daniel to help him.

It seems that Michael and Robert both entered the room and took the phone from Daniel while he was still on with 911 and hung up the line. But it was too late for the boys to make a clean getaway. I’ll link the 911 call, but trigger warning for all the bad things.

Then Michael stabbed Daniel 21 times in his back, shoulders, and chest. The next victim was their father David who had somehow slept through most of the attack. He was stabbed 28 times with a huge knife.

Right at that time, there was a knock from the police at the door. When the cops broke into the home, they heard Crystal faintly calling for help. Crystal received first aid and was stabilized.

Aftermath
At the scene
But Robert and Michael were nowhere to be found. But these kids aren’t criminal masterminds and they were found by police dogs in a wooded area behind the home.

Robert came out of the woods first and willingly, but Michael didn’t and had the police dogs sent after him. In photos after their arrest, you can see that their clothes are ripped, muddy, and bloody. Michael even had bite marks and Robert still had his Kevlar on.

Robert Bever
Michael Bever
In the end, David Bever, April Bever, Daniel Bever, Christopher Bever, and Victoria Bever were all declared dead at the scene. Two-year-old Autumn was safe and sound asleep in her crib.

Neither of the boys showed any emotion or remorse when they were taken into custody. According to investigators, Robert said that he was proud of what he had done.

Police obviously found Robert’s notebook which contained the details of their horrific plan. Oh, and one of the boys mentioned a flash drive while they were arrested that had more plans. One thing that they planned and were not able to carry out was beheading their two-year-old sister Autumn. Read that one more time.

Police located videos taken by the brothers of the murders, but those tapes have never been released to the public for obvious reasons.

Interrogations
Crystal was able to tell the police who had attacked her before undergoing emergency surgery. She somehow miraculously survived the ordeal.

While Crystal was fighting for her life at the hospital, back at the police station, Robert was the first to be interviewed. He admitted to everything right away and repeated that he was proud of his actions. It was also reported that he often smiled and laughed during his interview.

He went on a tangent about that movie Rampage that he was obsessed with and basically said that it was okay to kill people because eventually, you will kill someone who deserved it. I’m not really following that logic, but whatever you say, Robert. For some reason, footage of Robert’s interrogation was never released to the public but Michael’s was.

Michael mostly tried to blame Robert for the events of that night. He basically said that he just watched while Robert killed their family. But the cops had already talked to Robert and they confronted Michael about the inconsistencies between their stories.

After being caught in lies, Michael admitted to killing some of his family but that he only did it because he was afraid of Robert.

Trials and sentences

Robert and Michael were charged with five counts each of first-degree murder, one count of assault and battery with intent to kill. Robert was 18 at the time of the murders and charged as an adult, but Michael was only 16. Still, Michael was also charged as an adult.

Robert was eligible for the death penalty, while the court ruled that Michael could not be sentenced to death because of his age at the time of the murders.

Robert took a plea deal and was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. But Michael wouldn’t take a deal. Maybe because he knew he wasn’t facing the death penalty? And Michael pretty much stuck to the story that he was innocent and was deathly afraid of Robert.

Robert even took the stand in Michael’s trial to back his story up.

At Michael’s trial, the alleged abuse the kids suffered at the hands of their father was brought up. Robert said they were abused and Crystal has also reportedly claimed the home was abusive.

But in the end, Michael was found guilty and sentenced to the same punishment as his brother.

Aftermath
At some point, Robert attacked two prison guards. In July 2016, Robert attempted to hang himself in his prison cell with a bedsheet. He was cut down and put on suicide watch. He is currently at the Joseph Harp Correctional Center serving his five life sentences.

Michael is currently being held at the Lexington Correctional Center.

Crystal and Autumn were adopted by the same family.

And as for the house of horrors where the family was attacked, the Broken Arrow government tried to raise money to purchase the home to build a park. But in 2017, the house was destroyed by a fire. Some suspected arson.

But in March 2019, The Bever Family-First Responders Memorial Park was opened where the house once stood.

If you are at all interested in true crime, you have probably heard about the murder of four University of Idaho students in November of last year. And if you’re not interested in true crime, you also have probably heard about the murders. Last week 48 Hours beat the other crime news programs to covering the case on January 7. I was disappointed with that episode though because it was too short and didn’t cover much of the investigation and arrest of Bryan Kohberger. But Dateline is here this week with everything I wanted to know about the case. And Keith Morrison is here, so that’s always fun.

Synopsis
Latest in the investigation into the murder of four University of Idaho students.

NBC
A murder on King Street
First up, we meet Martha who was a sophomore at the University of Idaho. On November 13, 2022, she went to the Sigma Chi fraternity house to work on a group project.

But classmate Hunter Chapin never showed up. So Martha called Hunter who told her that his brother Ethan (triplets, actually) was dead.

Martha then text Ethan’s girlfriend Xana Kernodle to let her know she was thinking of her. But Martha would never get a text back from Xana because she was killed with Ethan.

Dateline Killings in a College Town Recap
Now, Keith Morrison takes us back to the morning of November 13, 2022, to go over the early facts of the case.

The police in Moscow, Idaho, had received a report of an unconscious person around lunch that day at a house on King Road.

Meanwhile, Kaylee Goncalves’s parents were becoming worried because they couldn’t reach their daughter. So, they called Kaylee’s best friend Madison Mogen. No answer there either.

Kaylee had recently moved out from the house on King Road, but was spending the night with her BFF Maddie. The fact that she was there for just one night makes the murders more tragic, if that’s possible.

Next, we get a list of the victims:

Madison Mogen, 21 years old
Kaylee Goncalves, 21 years old
Ethan Chapin, 20 years old
Xana Kernodle, 21 years old
From top left clockwise: Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and Kaylee Goncalves
From top left clockwise: Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and Kaylee Goncalves
Two of the roommates that lived in the house survived the attack: Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke

After the discovery of the crime scene, police issued a statement saying that there was no ongoing risk to the community. That makes it sound like they know who did it and they are in custody.

But the next day, classes were canceled and Martha and her sorority sisters slept together in the living room of their house hoping that the police were right.

The victims
After we come back from the commercial break, Keith informs us that the famous photo of the roommates was actually taken the day before the murders. I did not know that and was shocked. It makes the photo much more poignant.


This was the first homicide in Moscow, Idaho, in seven years. And for some reason, the investigation was very hush-hush. I know that the police will hold back information that only the killer would know, but they were extra tight-lipped on this one.

A reporter tells us that he called the mayor of Moscow who told him that this was a crime of passion. But we now know that it wasn’t. It was planned.

Ethan and Xana were found dead on the second floor of the three-story house. And Kaylee and Maddie’s bodies were on the third floor in the same bed.


The crime scene was apparently so gruesome that some investigators and EMTs weren’t allowed into the house.

Next it’s time for a little victim background.

Ethan was majoring in recreation, sports and tourisms while Xana was a gymnast majoring in marketing. Xana also worked at the Mad Greek restaurant along with Maddie.

Kaylee’s parents tell us that you can’t talk about their daughter without also talking about Maddie. They were inseperable.

Kaylee was a high achiever and she even had a job lined up in Dallas in the IT field. She had recently moved out and bought herself a new Range Rover.

True crime TikTok

It’s time for a collage of news clips and we get one from our very own Lester Holt. The world was watching Moscow, Idaho.

TikTok sleuths were pouring over reports and videos hoping to solve the case and I really need Keith to stop talking about me. Keith says most of the TikTok videos were wild speculation, which they were. I agree that those were not helpful in the beginning of the investigation.

Some of the speculations included a possible stalker and a medium even got involved.

48 hours after the initial entry into the home, police announced that an edged weapon had been used and they were on the lookout for a military-style knife.

At the next press conference, the Moscow police changed their tune about the threat level to the community. Before, there was no threat, but now that wasn’t true. They didn’t have any suspects so the threat was very much still there.


We also learn that the only entry into the house is on the backside of the second floor. That is where the killer had to have entered. Some of the talking heads wonder if perhaps Ethan and Xana who were on the second floor were just collateral damage. As in, the killer was actually after Maddie or Kaylee on the third floor.

But there were no signs of sexual assault on any of the victims. Does that mean that sex wasn’t a motive? Not necessarily. Perhaps the killer didn’t have time to commit any rapes.

The fact that the murderer used his own knife could be considered Freudian. A sort of display of his power. Guns are more common murder weapons. Knives are scarier and meant to frighten victims.

Party hard
As the community held vigils for the murdered students, the police were keeping what they knew under wraps. Was there DNA evidence?

There’s a bit of a problem with the DNA at the house. The house on King Street was known for parties. The police were called several times about noise complaints. And the night before the murders, there was a party in the home with as many as 150 people attending. Any DNA found, could be totally useless.


That Saturday night before their early Sunday morning deaths, Ethan and Xana went to a party at the Sigma Chi house around 9:30.

Kaylee and Maddie went to a bar in Moscow called the Corner Club. They left around 1:30 a.m. to grab some grub at a food truck down the block.


All four of the victims were home by 2 a.m.

Apparently, at 3 a.m., the police responded to a report of underage drinking nearby. Now that incident is unrelated to the murders, but at 3:12 a.m., a scream can be heard on the body cam footage. Or at least that’s what Keith Morrison told me. I listened to it several times and didn’t hear any screams.

Other video footage would be looked at by investigators, and this brings us to a commercial break and up next is food truck guy.

Suspects
Jack DuCoeur and Kaylee
Jack DuCoeur and Kaylee
Among the early suspects that Reddit and TikTok sleuths focused on was Kaylee’s ex-boyfriend Jack DuCoeur.

The couple had broken up a few weeks before the murders but according to Kaylee’s parents, the split was amicable.

In fact, the pair had a dog named Murphy together and they had been sharing custody since the split. Kaylee had Murphy the night of the murders. So if Kaylee had Murphy, why didn’t anyone hear him barking at the attacker? Surely he would have. Unless he knew the killer. Was it his other owner?

Kaylee and Murphy
Kaylee and Murphy
Starting with current and former romantic partners is always a good idea. And there was more than a little suspicion of Jack. Leading up to the murders, Kaylee called Jack repeatedly but he never answered. No one really knows the reason for the phone calls, but Jack became a target for hate messages from people convinced of his guilt.

Jack wasn’t the only suspect the internet set its eyes on during the early days of the investigation. After leaving the Corner Club, Kaylee and Maddie went to that food truck. And lurking behind them was a guy in a hoodie and a hat. He seems to watch the girls before putting his hood over his head.

Then when the girls walked away, he threw one of his hands up in apparent frustration or exasperation and then walked off in the direction of the murder scene.

Food truck guy lived nearby and he had once posted a photo with a large knife. But the police cleared him without explanation. I don’t think he was involved but I’m curious to know what prompted investigators to clear him.

And those pesky TikTokers were scouring the digital footprints of the victims and possible suspects.

During all this time, the victims’ families say that they were kept in the dark. The only family in the Dateline coverage was Kaylee’s parents, and they feared the case was going cold. But they didn’t know about the white Elantra.

The Hyundai Elantra
December rolled around and there was still no real news or leads that the police released to the public. But they did tell everyone to be patient.

On December 7, the police announced that they were looking for a 2011-2013 Hyundai Elantra with Pennsylvania tags that was spotted near the scene at the time of the murders.

It seemed like the police knew more about this car than they were letting on.

Hey, Lester Holt is here again.


I remember this part very vividly. A white Hyundai Elantra was found in Eugene, Oregon, and it was all smashed up. This discovery sent the internet into a tizzy, but it turned out to be a false lead.

The car that police were actually looking for drove by the house on King Street three times before the murders. So police issued a BOLO for the car to other police agencies. A campus cop at Washington State University, which is only ten miles from Moscow, Idaho, ran a search for registered white Elantras on campus. They found one match: Bryan Kohberger, a criminology grad student and teaching assistant.


The campus cops checked the car out, but it had Washington tags, not Pennsylvania. Plus it was a 2015, and Moscow PD was looking for a 2011-2013. But they turned the tip in any way. That tip was one of many that police had to scour through.

The arrest

Bryan’s parents’ house
Christmas break rolled around, and Bryan Kohberger was heading to Pennsylvania to spend the holidays with his family. Did he know he was in trouble? That sheath he left behind must have haunted him.

Bryan’s dad flew to Washington state to make the cross-country drive with his son. But on the way, they were pulled over twice in Indiana. I had heard that the police were onto Bryan at this point and had asked Indiana officials to pull him over. But apparently it was just a coincidence.

Meanwhile, a genealogist told the police to focus on a certain family tree based on the DNA that was found on the knife sheath. Bryan Kohberger, who owned a white Hyundai Elantra was a member of that family.

So the police got a warrant for Bryan’s cell phone records and made some damning discoveries. Bryan’s phone had been turned off during the time of the murders. But it pinged at the murder scene a few hours later. It appears that Bryan returned to the scene of the crime. Shouldn’t he know better as a criminology student?

And his phone was near the scene at least 12 times leading up to the murders. Sometimes he was close enough to pick up the students’ wifi. Not looking good for Bryan.

Bryan’s car was spotted pulling back onto campus not long after the murders. The police were now focusing on Bryan.

The FBI was staking out the Kohbergers’ home in Pennsylvania and they pulled DNA from the trash outside. The DNA belonged to the father of the murderer.

After that discovery, things happened quickly. The house was surrounded and they FBI and state police went in with force, even breaking windows and doors. Bryan was arrested without incident, but all of the public was wondering who Bryan even was.

Bryan Kohberger
Bryan Kohberger
Who’s Bryan?
Obviously, the media quickly reported the developments in the case as they happened. Press conferences were held and we learned more about Bryan.

As a teenager, Bryan was bullied over his weight and after high school he told his friend Casey that he had developed a heroin addiction that he was going to rehab. Casey lost touch with Bryan after that until she saw him at a wedding in 2017.

She hugged Bryan and he seemed very uncomfortable. She never saw him speak to anyone else at the wedding.

Bryan Kohberger
Bryan Kohberger
Next, we meet Madison, a former classmate at DeSales University. She last saw him in 2020 in a class. She says that Bryan was a know-it-all and that his classmates found him insufferable.

And Madison said that he had a creepy way of staring at people, which I can see from the photos and videos I’ve seen of Bryan. She said that he didn’t seem to have any friends.

Pappa Rodger
Bryan Kohberger
Bryan Kohberger
I mentioned before that Bryan was a teaching assistant at Washington State. According to one of his students that we meet, he was a very harsh grader. This student clearly didn’t like Bryan as a teacher.

But he said that one day, Bryan suddenly started giving everyone in the class 100s. And that was right around the time of the murders. According to a psychologist, Bryan might have undergone a transformation after the release of stress the murders would have been for him.

After Bryan’s arrest, internet investigators went back through all the footage looking for signs of Bryan. And some of them think they spotted him at a vigil on November 30, but it wasn’t him.

But was Bryan inserting himself into the investigation in other ways? Perhaps.

This is the most fascinating and creepy part of this case to me. A Facebook user going by the name Pappa Rodger was commenting in a Facebook group dedicated to the case. He mentioned that a sheath would have been left at the scene six days before the police announced that.


He even argued with someone about the likelihood of a sheath. The person he was arguing with told Bryan that he sounded like a serial killer. And after Bryan’s arrest, the Pappa Rodger account went silent.

While it’s not confirmed that the Pappa Rodger account belongs to Bryan, we know that he posted a survey on Reddit asking about the emotions and psychology that impact the decision-making of criminals. Weird, right?

The probable cause affidavit

It’s important to remember that Bryan has only been arrested and not convicted. He’s innocent under the eyes of the law. Do I think that will be true forever? No. I would be shocked if he is exonerated.

Six days after his arrest, Moscow police released the probable cause affidavit that was used to get a warrant for Bryan’s arrest. Here’s what we learned from the affidavit.

Another roommate, who I am not going to name because the affidavit heard someone say something to the effect of “It’s okay. I’m going to help you.” The she saw a man around 4 a.m. after she heard what she thought was Kaylee playing with her dog Murphy.

The man was wearing a mask and black clothes. I’m not sure what kind of mask exactly. I assume it’s a surgical mask or a cloth masked used to prevent the spread of Covid. If that’s not the case, please let me know.

Bryan Kohberger

The surviving roommate froze and then hid in her bedroom. It’s not clear from the affidavit whether or not the intruder saw the roommate. But it was another eight hours before the police were called to check on an unconscious person.

I read somewhere that a surviving roommate actually passed out after seeing the murder scene and that was why the police were called. That could be a total fabrication, but the unconscious person thing has never made sense to me.

The affidavit also revealed that a knife sheath was found in the room with Kaylee and Maddie.

What now?
Ethan and Xana
Kaylee and Maddie
Based on the facts of the case, the defense team has quite a task ahead of them. So far, Bryan pleaded not guilty, but it’s not clear what his defense will be.

It’s of course possible that Bryan will change his plea and take a deal to avoid the death penalty, which is at play in Idaho. It seems unlikely that any of the victims’ families will be in favor of a deal, but the prosecution doesn’t have to take that into account.

At the end of this two-hour episode with commercials, we still don’t know why. Why did Bryan Kohberger who didn’t seem to know any of the victims plan a mass murder?

We may not know for quite a while. Bryan waved his right to a speedy hearing and the next prelim hearing is scheduled for June 2023.

Meanwhile, students at the University of Idaho have returned for the spring semester. And I hope they can breathe a little easier knowing that the killer has been apprehended.

Let me know your thoughts on the case and episode below! And among Dateline, 20/20, and 48 Hours, which did you think was the best?
Hey, y’all. When I tell you that today’s case is rough, I mean it is rough. You would think that after years of learning about murders, I could handle most anything. But, no. Murderous teenage mean girls and the torture of a twelve-year-old are beyond the pale for me. On the night of June 10, 1992, and into the early morning hours of June 11, 1992, 12-year-old Shanda Renee Sharer was tortured for hours before dying from being burned alive by four teenage girls (Melinda Loveless, Laurie Tackett, Hope Rippey, and Toni Lawrence) in Madison, Indiana. 

Content warning for pretty much everything: violence, torture, sexual assault.

The girls
Before I dive into the events of June 10 & 11, 1992, I think it’s important to discuss the backgrounds of all the girls involved. I am by no means making excuses for any of their behavior. But it’s important for context to understand where they came from, particularly Melinda Loveless. 

When I began researching this case, I was overwhelmed by the complexity of the relationships among the girls. After the girls’ biographies, there’s a cheat sheet of the relationships that I hope will help.

Toni Lawrence
Toni Lawrence
Toni Lawrence
Toni Lawrence was 15 years old in 1992.

Toni was molested when she was only nine years old by a family member and she was also raped by a teenage boy when she was 14. The police ordered the teen who raped Toni to stay away from her.

Like the rest of the girls that were involved with Shanda’s murder, Toni began self-harming and became sexually active as a young teenager.

Before the night of the murder she had never met Melinda or Shanda and she had only met Laurie one time.

Hope Rippey
Hope Rippey
Hope Rippey
At the time of Shanda’s murder, Hope Rippey was 15. She was born and raised in Madison, Indiana by her father who was an engineer and her mother.

According to Hope, her childhood was unstable. But according to reports, there was never a claim of any kind of abuse in the Rippey home.

Like the other girls in this story, Hope was attracted to women. She identified as bisexual.

Toni and Hope were best friends.

Laurie Tackett
Laurie Tackett
Laurie Tackett
Laurie Tackett was also from Madison, Indiana, but at 17 years old, she was the oldest of the perpetrators of this crime.

Like Hope and Toni, Laurie was also a victim of sexual assault. She claimed to have been molested at the age of five and 12.

Laurie’s family was deeply conservative Pentecostal Christian, so when her mother discovered that Laurie had been changing into jeans at school, she was furious. So furious that she tried to strangle her daughter. Overreaction, I think. To monitor the home situation, authorities started doing unannounced visits to the Tackett home.

Laurie had a bit of a rebellious streak. She was interested in the occult and when Laurie’s mother discovered that Hope had bought a ouija board, she insisted that the board be destroyed and that Hope’s house be exorcised.

Unsurprisingly, dropping the hammer seemed to have the opposite effect. She only became more rebellious and more deeply involved in the occult. She claimed that she was possessed by a vampire and was known to read runestones.

She also committed self-harm, and her parents checked her into a psychiatric unit when they learned that she was cutting herself. She was prescribed an antidepressant, but two days later, she cut her wrists again. She was then diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

Laurie dropped out of high school in 1991.

Melinda Loveless
Melinda Loveless
Melinda Loveless
Where to even start with Melinda Loveless’s background. Without writing an entire book about it (Which Aphrodite Jones did, and you should totally read it).

Shanda Sharer
But I will start with Melinda’s father Larry Loveless who was a sexual deviant who forced his wife to engage in orgies against her will.

Larry Loveless
Larry Loveless
Larry and his wife Margie Loveless would often hang out at bars, and Larry would pretend to be a lawyer or a doctor. He also told bar patrons that Margie was his girlfriend, not his wife. He did all of this to entice other couples or sometimes single men and women to return to their home to either swap partners or engage in group sex.

Larry enjoyed watching his wife have sex with other men. He once had Margie gang raped, and she attempted suicide after the assault.

Another time, Margie refused to have sex with Larry for a month and Larry raped her while his three daughters, including Melinda, were outside the room.

I have to wonder if this behavior totally warped Melinda’s concepts of attachment, romance, and sex. I mean I don’t actually wonder. I know that it did.

When Melinda was five, the family began attending a local baptist church for two years. Larry swore off his drinking, violence, and sexual behaviors during that time.

Also during that time, Larry became convinced that Melinda was possessed by a demon. He arranged for a 50-year-old man to perform an exorcism on Melinda in a hotel room. Alone. Melinda says she slept the whole time, but I have doubts.

And in case you’re wondering, Larry was abusive to his three daughters. He shot at one of them, beat them, and sexually assaulted them. Melinda claims he never molested or raped her, but her two older sisters insist that he did.

Larry would make Melinda sleep in his bed with him. He would also wear the girls’ underwear and makeup. In 1990, Larry took Melinda and one of her friends to a public swimming pool. While the girls were changing, Larry stole their clothes and Melinda had to go out of the changing room in the nude to retrieve them. Margie was rightfully furious.

This all sounds like a recipe for making your children hate you. But Melinda didn’t. She was her dad’s favorite and she loved him. When Larry and her mother divorced, Melinda was devastated and felt abandoned. And eventually, Larry stopped contacting Melinda, and he died in 1998.

Shanda
Shanda Sharer
Shanda Sharer
And now, we have reached our victim, Shanda Sharer. Shanda had a normal and happy childhood from what I’ve seen.

But Shanda’s parents divorced in 1991, and she and her mother moved to Madison, Indiana, from Kentucky.

She enrolled at Hazelwood Middle School for a time, but transferred to Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic School that same year.

Shanda was active in extracurriculars. She was a cheerleader and played volleyball and basketball.

Melinda and Amanda Heavrin
Amanda Heavrin
Amanda Heavrin
In 1990, Melinda Loveless met and started dating a girl named Amanda Heavrin. Melinda was 14 at the time. Initially, Melinda’s mother was upset that her daughter was gay, but she eventually came around.

But the romantic relationship wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Melinda admitted to being sexually abusive to Amanda and it seems that Melinda was the one in control. Melinda was also wildly jealous of anyone who spoke to Amanda.

Eventually, Amanda grew tired of Melinda’s behavior and stopped talking with her as much, though they never officially broke up.

Shanda and Amanda
Even though Amanda and Melinda never had a breakup conversation, Amanda (14 at the time) met Shanda (12) at Hazelwood Junior High after they got into a physical fight. The two girls were punished with detention, and they became friends there.

After that, the girls grew close very quickly, and eventually romance bloomed. They communicated mostly by writing notes to each other. Amanda thought that Shanda was pretty and liked how feminine she was.

The pair attended a school dance together in October 1991, and 16-year-old Melinda Loveless. She threatened to kill Shanda if she didn’t stop talking to Amanda. And she often wrote letters about how much she hated Shanda and wanted her out of the picture.

All this is just indicative of Melinda’s immaturity to me. She had no idea what a normal relationship looked like. Violence and sexual abuse were normal to her.

After the dance, that’s when Shanda’s parents transferred her from Hazelwood to the Catholic school to hopefully diffuse the situation and keep Shanda away from both Amanda and Melinda. Rightfully so, Shanda’s mother didn’t like how much older Amanda was than Shanda. This didn’t work though, unfortunately.

Shanda and Amanda continued to communicate against Shanda’s parents’ wishes.


Here’s my attempt at visualizing the relationships among the six girls.
true crime merch
Events of that night 
The rock show
We have finally arrived at January 10, 1992. That night, Toni, Hope, Laurie, and Melinda piled into Laurie’s car to go. Neither Toni nor Hope had met Melinda before that day.

When they picked up Melinda, she showed them a knife and said that she planned to scare Shanda with it. Laurie already knew about the plan prior to that day.

The girls drove to Shanda’s house after asking for directions at a McDonald’s. Once they found Shanda’s house, Toni and Hope knocked on the door. Melinda couldn’t because Shanda would have recognized her and never left with her.

Shanda’s dad saw the girls and knew something was up because they asked if Shanda was home, but Shanda was standing right behind him. He knew the girls didn’t know who Shanda was.

Toni and Hope invited Shanda to go see Amanda, but Shanda’s dad said no. Shanda told them to come back after midnight and she would sneak out.

Melinda was annoyed that the girls couldn’t convince Shanda to leave with them, but she agreed to the plan to return for her later. After that, the four of them went to a punk show in New Albany. Melinda and Laurie watched all of the show, but Toni and Hope got bored and when out to Laurie’s car with a pair of boys they met at the show. I’m sure you can imagine what happened in the car.

Abduction
The girls eventually returned to Shanda’s house. On the way, Melinda was going on about how she couldn’t wait to kill Shanda, but then she also said she just planned to scare her. I personally think that Melinda planned to kill Shanda all along.

This time, Toni refused to go to Shanda’s door, so Laurie and Hope knocked. They convinced Shanda that Amanda was waiting for her at the Witch’s Castle in Utica. The place was haunted according to Laurie, but most people call the property Mistletoe Falls because lots of mistletoe grew there. Duh.

Witch's Castle
Witch’s Castle
Anyway, Melinda was seated in the middle of the front seat of Laurie’s car while Melinda hid under a blanket in the backseat. Once they were on the road, Melinda popped up with a knife while Hope was asking Shanda about her relationship with Amanda. Then Melinda put the knife to Shanda’s throat and basically interrogated her about her sexual relationship with Amanda.

Once at Witch’s Castle, which is in a remote location, the girls tied Shanda up with rope and threatened to cut off her pretty hair. Melinda took all of Shanda’s rings and gave them to the other girls. Hope even took Shanda’s Mickey Mouse watch. Let that sink in. Shanda was young enough to still wear a Mickey Mouse watch. Heartbreaking.

Laurie lit a t-shirt on fire to scare Shanda, but she worried that cars passing by the building would see the fire, so they put Shanda back in the car and took off.

This is where the really bad stuff starts
Shanda Sharer
Shanda Sharer
Laurie drove to an abandoned building in a rural area. Toni and Hope were scared at this point and wouldn’t get out of the car.

But Laurie and Melinda weren’t frightened. They made Shanda take off her clothes and then beat her with their hands. Melinda even slammed Shanda’s face onto her knee repeatedly, which is extra horrific because Shanda had just had braces put on and she started bleeding profusely.

After beating her, Melinda tried to cut Shanda’s throat but her knife was too dull. At this point, Hope got out of the car and helped hold Shanda down. She later told Toni that she was trying to help Shanda but I have doubts about that.

Laurie and Melinda stabbed Shanda multiple times in the chest and then strangled her with a rope. They threw her into the back of the trunk and said that she was dead. She wasn’t.

They returned to Laurie’s house to hang out and clean up. They were covered in blood. But while they were drinking soda (or Coke as I would call it in Alabama), Shanda began to scream from the trunk of the car.

Worried that the neighbors would hear, Laurie took a knife and stabbed Shanda again. She returned a few minutes later covered in blood again. Then Laurie read runestones and told the girls that they said everything would be okay.

Around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of January 11, 1992, Laurie and Melinda went for a drive with Shanda in the trunk. Shanda would occasionally scream or make gurgling noises and the girls would pull over to beat her with a tire iron until she shut up. She sat bolt upright with bloody eyes at one of these stops.

I’m going to gloss over this, but Shanda was also sexually assaulted with that tire iron.

They drove around with Shanda for hours, assaulting her throughout. Until sunrise actually. Then they went back to Laurie’s house to clean up. Hope and Toni said they were asleep at Laurie’s house during the joy ride.

Burned alive

The four girls got back into the car and went to a gas station where they filled a two-liter Pepsi bottle with gasoline and then drove Shanda to Lemon Road, which is in an isolated area.

Shanda was still alive when they finally stopped. Can you imagine? What a fighter. It always amazes me when humans survive horrific attacks like this. And the really sad thing is that Toni and Hope had opportunities to save Shanda. Their claims of being scared of Melinda and Laurie fall flat for me when you consider that they were alone for hours. They could have told their parents or the police and Shanda might have survived.

When they opened the trunk, Hope sprayed Shanda’s wounds with Windex, reportedly saying “You don’t look so hot now do you?” Like Hope can say all day that she didn’t want to participate, but her actions tell me otherwise.

They wrapped Shanda in a blanket, and Shanda actually gripped the blanket and I’m sobbing as I write this. Then they poured gasoline on her and dropped a match on her. Melinda worried that there wasn’t enough gas, so she poured more on her.

Then they left Shanda on the side of that rural road and went to McDonald’s for breakfast. They even joked that Shanda looked like the sausage they were eating.

Toni called a friend and told her about the murder. I believe that Toni was terrified and that she didn’t want to participate, but she’s still culpable here.

After breakfast, Laurie dropped Hope and Toni off at their homes. Then Melinda told Amanda that they had killed Shanda. They picked Amanda up later that day with another friend named Crystal Wathen. Crystal and Amanda didn’t believe the story until Laurie showed them her trunk which still had blood in it.

Amanda immediately asked to be taken back home and told Melinda she wouldn’t tell anyone about the murder.

 
Discovery of Shanda’s body
Later that day, Shanda’s parents began to worry about Shanda and filed a missing person report.

At the same time, two brothers spotted what they thought was a pile of rags or a mannequin on the side of Lemon Road. They called the police at 1:55 a.m. on the 11th to report their discovery.

The police didn’t initially didn’t know whose body they had found, but they noted that the body was in the boxing pose that burn victims are often found in. And they also noticed that the body was posed in a suggestive manner and that her panties had been pushed to the side.

The cause of death was later found to be smoke inhalation. She was burned alive.

On the evening of the 11th, Hope and Toni went to the police to tell a horrifying story. Toni was reportedly hysterical and hard to understand. Toni said that she caved under peer pressure.

This confirmed to police that the body that they had found likely was Shanda Sharer. That suspicion would later be confirmed by dental records.

Consequences
Melinda Loveless, Laurie Tackett, Toni Lawrence, and Hope Rippey
Melinda Loveless, Laurie Tackett, Toni Lawrence, and Hope Rippey
All four girls were arrested and charged as adults. They all took plea deals to avoid the death penalty.

Earlier, I went through the backgrounds of the girls and there was a pattern of abuse in all of their lives. And I know that isn’t an excuse for any of them, but it was a mitigating factor that was taken into consideration for their sentences.

Toni Lawrence was sentenced to a maximum of 20 years because she cooperated with the police. She only served nine years and finished her parole in 2002.

Hope Rippey was initially sentenced to 60 years but a judge reduced that to 35 years. She was released in 2006 and stayed on parole until 2011.

Laurie Tackett was sentenced to 60 years. On January 11, 2018, the 26-year anniversary of the murder, Laurie was released and is still on parole.


Melinda Loveless was sentenced to 60 years in prison, but she was released on parole in 2019.

Before her release, Melinda spent several years training service dogs through the Indiana Canine Assistant Network, a program in the prison. Shanda’s mother donated one dog a year in Shanda’s memory and Melinda trained those dogs. Shanda’s mom felt that this was something good coming from Shanda’s death.

Larry Loveless’s arrest
After all of Melinda’s abuse was exposed during the murder investigation, her father Larry Loveless was arrested for rape, sodomy, and sexual battery. But only one charge of sexual battery stuck because the statute of limitations had passed on all of the other charges.

He was sentenced to time served and was released from prison in 1995. He tried to sue the jail after his release because he claimed he suffered cruel and unusual punishment. What kind of punishment? He wasn’t allowed to sleep during the day or read the newspaper. So cruel lol.

Larry died in 1998 after jumping into traffic.

Final thoughts

God, this is an awful story. The brutal murder of Shanda Sharer is on par with the Sylvia Likens case or the Junko Furuta case in its level of horror.

Do you think the girls were sentenced to enough time? I’m on the fence on that one. It seems like all of these girls were destined to a difficult life based on the abuse in their young lives. But that doesn’t erase what they did to Shanda.


Hey, y’all. Today, I have the story of Darlie Routier and the murder of her two sons Devon Routier and Damon Routier. Notice that I didn’t say that Darlie is the one who murdered them because I’m not certain that she did. I have a passion for wrongful conviction cases. I think Making a Murderer really lit that fire for me. So, I’m researching cases I would like to cover when I came across the story of Darlie Routier.

On June 6, 1996, Devon and Damon were murdered in their home in Rowlett, Texas. Darlie would eventually be convicted of murdering one of the boys in 1997 and sentenced to death. But did she actually murder them? That’s a difficult question to answer and after spending hours and hours researching this case, reading trial transcripts, and watching documentaries about it, I still don’t really know the answer.

Background
Marriage and children
Darlie Lynn Peck met Darin Routier in 1985 at the Western Sizzlin restaurant in Lubbock, Texas. Darin was 17, and Darlie was 15. Ahhh, young love warms my cold dead heart. But this story doesn’t have a fairy tale ending.

The pair were set up by Darlie’s mother Darlie Kee. They quickly fell in love and were married in August 1988. And about nine months later on June 14, 1989, their first son Devon was born. Then in 1991, another boy followed. They named him Damon. Darlie and Darin had a third son named Drake in 1991.

Darin and Darlie Rouier

So if you’re keeping track, we have Darlie, Darin, Devon, Damon, and Drake. What do you think their favorite letter is?

Darlie’s version of events
Darlie Routier
Darlie Routier
Devin and Damon were murdered in the early morning hours of June 6, 1996. According to Darlie, she and the two boys fell asleep on the couch while watching TV. Her husband Darin and the youngest son Drake were asleep upstairs, and neither of them was harmed.

She said that she woke up to see that her two boys had been stabbed, and she saw a white man with a knife. She pursued the attacker through the utility room. The intruder dropped the knife and escaped the house through a cut screen in the garage.

The call lasted nearly six minutes until paramedics arrived. Devon was already dead by the time first responders arrived, but Damon was still alive. Darin attempted to perform CPR on Damon, but the air he blew into Damon’s mouth escaped through the wound in his chest just as quickly. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Sidenote: Darin has always supported Darlie’s wife’s claims of innocence.


Devon Routier and Damon Routier
Evidence
The police pretty quickly determined that Darlie was lying. They believe that she killed the boys and then cut herself to hide her involvement. In fact, the lead investigator said that he knew within minutes that it was a staged crime scene.

Darlie was arrested and charged with murder on June 18, 1996.

So let’s break down all the important evidence in the case.

The 911 Call
Darlie Routier
Darlie Routier
At 2:31 a.m. on June 6, 1966, Darlie made a frantic call from their big house on Eagle Drive. Through gasps and cries, she told the operator that someone had broken into her home, stabbed two of her children, and cut her throat. This call would later be used against Darlie at trial.

She referred to the intruder as “they” but then later said it was a man. Police said this was inconsistent and suspicious. I don’t agree with that at all. If you don’t know a person, referring to him or her as “they” is completely normal.

People who believe Darlie is guilty, also have latched on to a part of the recording in which she says that she picked up the knife that was used to stab her children. On the tape she says, “…we could have gotten the prints maybe.” Darlie’s critics are suspicious of this because it indicates that she is trying to explain why her fingerprints would be on the murder weapon.

But if you listen to the call in its entirety, the 911 dispatcher actually tells her not to touch anything, and that was what prompted Darlie to say that. It makes total sense to me.

The knife
Darlie Routier
The murder weapon was a knife that came from the Routier’s kitchen. Many believe that this choice of murder weapon rules out an intruder. Why would a burglar not bring their own weapon?

No valuables stolen
A pile of Darlie’s expensive jewelry was lying out in the open but had not been taken. A bit odd for an intruder not to take valuables that were there for the taking.

Behavior at the crime scene
According to David Waddell, the first officer on the scene, Darlie wasn’t worried about her children and wouldn’t help them. Darlie denies this, and the 911 call corroborates her story in my opinion.

She is heard comforting Damon on the call and continuously asked what was taking paramedics so long. And Officer Waddell told Darlie to sit down, which kind of contradicts Officer Waddell’s version of events.

Darlie Routier’s injuries
Darlie was rushed to Baylor University Medical Center because of her injuries. The slash on her neck was only two millimeters from her carotid artery. That could have been a fatal injury, and the wound required surgery.

She also had cuts on her arms, hands, and shoulders, which required stitching. Finally, she had a lot of bruising on the inside of both of her arms.

Investigators claimed that all of these wounds were shallow, superficial, and self-inflicted. And, according to police, serving the purpose of hiding Darlie’s involvement in the murders.

If I’m being honest, reader, and I will be, this is where I start to doubt Darlie’s guilt. I can’t look at the evidence photos of her injuries and call them superficial. She very well could have died from the neck wound.

And the bruises on her arms were severe and consistent with a struggle. The entire inside of both of her arms was solid black with bruising.

None of the doctors or nurses at Baylor testified that the wounds were definitely self-inflicted. They merely said that they could have been. Many things could be, but Occam’s Razor tells me that they probably weren’t.

Have you ever tried to give yourself a shot? I take monthly B12 injections, and I literally can’t push the needle in because I’m too scared. I can’t imagine cutting my own neck that deep.

Look at this slideshow of Darlie’s injuries and decide for yourself if these wounds were self-inflicted.

1 / 11
Blood evidence
The blood splatter in the house wasn’t necessarily consistent with an intruder breaking in. In fact, there was no blood in the garage that Darlie said she pursued the intruder through before he escaped through the screen door.

In the kitchen, forensic examiners discovered lots of Darlie’s blood in and around the kitchen sink. The theory here is that she stood at the sink to cut her own throat and arm.

Investigators maintain that the blood splatter on Darlie’s t-shirt was consistent with her raising a knife and stabbing her sons repeatedly.

Darlie Routier

The sock
Besides the severity of Darlie’s injuries, there is one other piece of evidence that really makes me doubt the state’s case. And that is a sock that was found lying near a trash can a few houses down the street.

The sock had both Devon and Damon’s blood on it, but not Darlie’s. And there was no blood around the sock. Just on it.

Darlie Routier
Here’s the thing about that sock. It blows a huge hole in the prosecution’s theory. Doctors said that Damon would only have lived for minutes after he was stabbed. Darlie was on the call for five minutes and 45 seconds. She was still on the call when both paramedics and police arrived.

So Darlie stabbed both children, called 911, went to the sink to cut herself and then went two houses down the street to dispose of that sock.

I just have a hard time buying that.

Fingerprint
Crime scene investigators found a smeared bloody fingerprint on the door frame to the utility room. The print doesn’t match any of the Routiers and as of now, it hasn’t been identified.

Exit point
Darlie Routier
The right window screen was cut.
Police maintain that there is no way someone left through the cut screen in the garage. They say this because the dust on the frame was undisturbed and no one had walked in the mulch in the backyard.

I found this compelling evidence against Darlie until I saw the pictures of the screen and the surrounding area. There isn’t mulch directly under the window. It’s several feet away. And the window is ground level. You could easily step over it without touching the frame.

The silly string tape
Darlie Routier
This is one of the weirder parts of this story. Devon’s 7th birthday was only a few days after his murder. In fact, his family had already sent out invitations to his party before his death.

On the day of his birthday, close friends and family held a memorial at his joint grave with Damon (they were buried holding hands and I can’t imagine anything more tragic).

After the solemn memorial, the group had a bit of a birthday celebration for Devon complete with Darlie smacking gum and spraying silly string on the grave. I know. Not a good look, Darlie.

But here’s the thing. That’s not really evidence to me. I can’t judge how a mother grieves her children. And let’s not forget that she hadn’t been out of the hospital all that long and was still on pain medicine.

Darlie said that she did that because Devon loved silly string and she wanted to honor that. I can understand that.

And the defense didn’t show the jury the tape of events before the silly string was brought out. Why didn’t they show it? I don’t know but I think it was a big mistake. Jurors rewatched the silly string incident seven or eight times during deliberations. It clearly played a large part in their decision.

Finances
Darlie Routier
What was Darlie’s motive for this atrocious act? According to the police, it was financial.

Darin owned a computer business called Testnec while Darlie was a stay-at-home mom. They had a beautiful home in Rowlett. And I mean beautiful. It was a mansion really. But here’s the thing, they couldn’t afford the lifestyle they were living.

They were two months behind on their mortgage and owed $10,000.00 in back taxes and $12,000.00 in credit card debt. Darin had been denied a loan only two days before the murders. Is that a coincidence? That’s a very good question.

But the boys only had around $10,000 in life insurance on them which was less than the cost of the funerals. So, I’m not really following that.

Basically, the police say that Darlie was watching her lavish lifestyle slip out of her hands as she fell deeper and deeper into debt and that to solve the problem, she killed her kids. They also argued that Darlie was vain because of her dyed blond hair and breast implants. But that does not a murderer make.

Alternate Theories
So, let’s just assume that Darlie is innocent. What are the other possibilities?

Actual intruder
The first choice is that it was a random attack. But nothing was stolen, so maybe the attacker meant to sexually assault Darlie and the boys woke up. This is all just speculation but it’s not outside the realm of what’s possible.

Was Darin involved?
Darin Routier
Darin Routier
We can’t really rule out Darin’s involvement. I have exactly zero evidence to support this theory, but I’m not taking it off the table.

Darlie claimed that Darin was asleep upstairs, but did he sneak down in the night after Darlie dozed off? The boys only had $10,000 in life insurance but Darlie had a six-figure policy with Darin as the beneficiary. Maybe Darin meant to only kill Darlie but the boys woke up.

If money really was the motive in this crime, wouldn’t Darin be the better suspect? But on the other hand, would Darin shout his wife’s innocence from the rooftops if he were the actual guilty party? Shouldn’t he want her on death row instead of him?

Insurance scheme
The last theory that holds any water in my opinion is that Devon and Damon were killed by an intruder that Darin had arranged to burglarize the house in an insurance fraud scheme.

The theory is that Darin set someone up to rob his home so that he could file claims on the missing items with his insurance. The family was supposed to leave for Pennsylvania a few days after the attack to visit Darlie’s parents.

So was the plan for the robbery to happen while they were out of town? Makes sense, but that’s not what happened. That night, neither Darlie’s car nor Darin’s car was in the driveway. It’s possible that the person working with Darin believed no one was home. The three woke up downstairs and they had no choice but to kill them.

Oh, and Darin signed an affidavit swearing that he had arranged the scam.

Where is Darlie Routier now?
Darlie Routier
Darlie Routier
Darlie Routier was convicted of capital murder in Damon’s case. She has never been tried for Devon’s murder.

She is currently on death row at the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville, Texas.

Darlie’s appellate team is still working hard and the Innocence Project in New York has been working on the case. New DNA testing on items that have never been tested was ordered by the court more than once since 2018, but the test results are still pending.

What do I think?
What a question. Cases like this are the exact reason that I don’t support the death penalty. I don’t know that Darlie is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I have doubts and many people consider me to be reasonable. The thought that a wrongfully convicted person will be executed is the kind of thing that keeps me up at night.

If I had to stake my life on Darlie’s innocence, I couldn’t do that. There are some incriminating pieces of evidence. But if I were on the jury, I would vote not guilty.

Where is justice for Damon and Devon? And Drake who is now an adult and had to grow up an only child without his mother?

And just as an interesting tidbit, Barbara Davis published Precious Angels: A True Story of Two Slain Children and a Mother Convicted of Murder in 1999, which vilified Darlie and denied any possibility of her innocence. But after seeing all of the evidence, she changed her mind. Davis cut her writing career short and feels that she is being punished for the book. Now she donates any proceeds from the book sales to the Routier family.

Let me know if you think Darlie is innocent or guilty in the comments! I’m truly on the fence on this one.

Hey, y’all. Thanks for stopping by. Last week the infamous Boy in the Box was finally identified as Joseph Augustus Zarelli and hopefully his case will eventually be solved. Joseph was killed in 1957, but wasn’t identified until 65 years, 9 months and 13 days later. That made me think about other unsolved cases. I came across the case of the murder of the Grimes sisters in Chicago took place in 1956, which is only a year before Joseph’s murder. The only way these old cases get solved is by people continuing to talk about them. Sometimes, cold cases warm back up.

P.S. Elvis makes an appearance in this story.

Love Me Tender

Barbara Grimes was born in 1941 and her sister Patricia Grimes was born in 1943 in Chicago, Illinois. They were two of their parents Loretta and Joseph Grimes’ six children.

The sisters were obsessed with Elvis. I mean really obsessed. People like to make fun of Harry Styles stans, but this isn’t a new phenomenon. They loved Elvis so much that on December 28, 1956, the duo went to the Brighton Theater to see the latest Elvis movie, Love Me Tender.

Murder of the Grimes Sisters
This wasn’t the first time Barbara and Patricia had seen the movie. One source says this was their 11th time, while another says it was their 15th, but regardless, they obviously loved the movie. Or Elvis. Either way.

The theater was only a mile and a half from their home in McKinley Park, and they left at 7:30 p.m. with $2.50 on them. They promised their mother they would be back by midnight. It’s not clear how the girls traveled to the theater, but most likely they took a bus or walked.

Times really are different now, aren’t they? It would be unheard of for a parent to let their adolescent daughters walk to the theater in a city. I suppose cases like this are why we are more protective of children.

Up and vanished
Murder of the Grimes Sisters
Barbara Grimes
Murder of the Grimes Sisters
Patricia Grimes
The theater was having a double feature, with the first showing ending at about 9:30. According to a friend who saw them at the movies, they stayed for the second showing and bought popcorn during the intermission. They appeared normal and happy. No red flags.

After the second showing, the girls would have arrived home around 11:45. By the time midnight rolled around, the girls hadn’t made it home, so their mother sent their older sister and brother to wait at the bus stop for them.

But three buses came and went with no Barbara or Patricia.

Loretta contacted the girls’ friends, but they weren’t at any of their houses, so at 2:15 a.m. on December 29, 1956, she filed a missing person report with Chicago PD.

Initially, police thought that the pair had run away from home or were with friends or their boyfriends. By December 31, the disappearance was front-page news, but the search didn’t really take off until a week passed with no contact from the girls.

This investigation is one of the largest investigations in Cook County history, with hundreds of police officers assigned to the search full-time. Cook County police called in assistance from neighboring areas and even formed a task force in hopes of locating the girls.

More than 15,000 flyers were given to people in the city and hung throughout. And her church offered a $1,000 reward, which is the equivalent of $9,945.26 if you account for inflation.

By the time the case went cold, police had interviewed 300,000 people. That is not a typo 300,000 interviews.

Elvis Presley even did a radio spot imploring the girls to return home.

Discovery of the bodies
Murder of the Grimes Sisters
Heavy snow melted away in January, and on January 22, 1957, construction worker Leonard Prescott saw something weird on the side of rural German Church Road. He described what he saw as “these flesh-colored things” and initially thought he was looking at mannequins. It’s almost never a mannequin, Leonard.

Because he didn’t realize what he had stumbled upon was the girls’ remains, he returned home and told his wife Marie about what he had seen. Leonard and Marie returned to German Church Road, and Marie reportedly fainted after realizing she was looking at the remains of two nude girls.

The bodies were on a flat section of ground right behind the guardrail. Barbara was on her left side, and Patricia was laying on her back on top of Barbara’s head. Police believed that this wasn’t the murder scene and that their bodies had either been placed or thrown over the guardrail.

Barbara had stab wounds that resembled an ice pick stab wound on her chest and there was evidence of a beating to her head and face. Patricia didn’t have any stab wounds, but she too had been badly beaten.

No evidence was found at the site where the sisters were found.

Cause of death
Murder of the Grimes Sisters
Murder of the Grimes Sisters
The next day, three forensic pathologists performed autopsies on the remains. They determined that the girls most likely died within five hours of being seen at the theater, making the time of death late December 28 or early December 29.

As for the actual cause of death, the experts reached the same conclusion of shock and exposure. If this sounds off to you, it did to me too. The pathologists came to this conclusion only by eliminating other possible causes of death.

They believed that the wounds were caused by rats and that the puncture wounds took place after their deaths. None of the wounds would have been fatal, and toxicology reports showed that the girls hadn’t been drunk or drugged.

Barbara had signs of sexual intercourse, but it’s not clear if this was consensual or not. I’m going to assume it wasn’t because she was murdered. Semen was found in Patricia, so it seems sexual assault could be a motive.

The girls’ clothing and personal belongings were never found.

Why did it take so long for the girls to be found? The theory is that they were placed there before the cold temperatures and snow and ice that blanked Chicago in January.

The chief investigator for the Cook County Coroner’s Office disagreed with this conclusion. Harry Glos went as far as to tell the media that the injuries were caused by violence, not rodents. He also believed that the girls had been alive until January 7 because there was a thin layer of ice over their remains, indicating that they were warm when the snow covered them and the snow fell on January 7th/8th.

I should note here that the girls had reputations for hanging outside of bars and asking older men to buy them alcohol. This doesn’t make their murders less important, but it’s a possible motive and opportunity.

Suspects
Walter Kranz
Walter Kranz was a 53-year-old steamfitter and a psychic. Do you guys believe in psychics? I personally think it’s a bunch of hooey, but I could be wrong.

Anyway, he called Chicago PD on January 15 to tell them that he had a vision of the location of the girls. This location was only a mile from where the bodies were eventually located. Walter refused to give the police his name, but they traced his phone call.

Handwriting experts say that Walter may have written a ransom note that was sent to Loretta before the discovery of their bodies.

But there was not enough to keep him, and he was released.

Charles Melquist
Murder of the Grimes Sisters
Charles Melquist
Charles Melquist was found guilty of murdering 15-year-old Bonnie Leigh Scott. Bonnie was killed in 1958 and her body was discovered not far from the location of the Grimes sisters.

Plus police found a note in Charles’ apartment with a list of young women who lived in the Grimes’s neighborhood.

He was interviewed by police but quickly released. There was speculation that Charles was protected by the Chicago mob.

Max Fleig
At the time of Barbara and Patricia’s death, Max Fleig was 17 years old. He was a prime suspect because of his age. I tried to find more information about this, but that’s the only explanation for his suspicion.

Max took a voluntary polygraph, which he failed, and he confessed to the murders. But because lie detector tests mean literally nothing, he was released. Oh, and it was illegal to subject minors to polygraphs. I guess the cops missed that day at the academy.

Interestingly, Max was later convicted of the murder of another young lady, so maybe he was involved.

Edward Bedwell
Murder of the Grimes Sisters
Edward “Bennie” Bedwell and his mother
Edward “Bennie” Bedwell was a 21-year-old driver who was originally from Tennessee. He was kicked out of his parents’ home in Chicago only a month before the Grimes murders. He worked at a restaurant in Chicago’s skid row.

Bennie reportedly looked like Elvis, making the idea that the girls would be interested in talking to him more plausible.

The owners of the restaurant informed police that they had seen Bennie and another young man at the restaurant with two young girls on December 30. The owners claimed the girls resembled the Grimes sisters.

Bennie was arrested on January 24 and was interrogated by police for three days. He eventually signed a 14-page confession. In the confession, he says that he and another man named William Cole Willingham were with the girls until January 7, partying and drinking at several bars in skid row.

But when the girls refused their sexual advances, Bennie and William beat them before dumping their bodies on the side of that road. But Bennie denied that the girls were the Grimes sisters and any involvement in the crime.

Bennie later recanted stating that he only confessed after being coerced for days by the police.

The autopsy didn’t support Bennie’s version of events in his confession. He claimed to have fed them hot dogs and that they were drinking alcohol, but neither was found the in the girls’ systems. And the girls had not been beaten to death.

Add to that Bennie’s alibi of being at work at the likely time of the girls’ abductions, and we know he didn’t do it. Innocent people confess all the time.

What now?
Murder of the Grimes Sisters
That’s really it. The case is as cold as Antarctica.

Loretta Grimes died in 1989 without ever knowing what really happened to her girls.

I can’t decide who I think is the culprit in this case. None of them seem very likely, but Max Fleig might be my first choice because he murdered another woman, but you could say that about Charles Melquist too.

Let me know who you think the culprit is in the comments below and if you have any information about the case, contact Cook County PD.

Most of us in the true crime world are familiar with the story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard and the murder of her mother Dee Dee. Dee Dee had Munchausen by proxy, and Gypsy Rose survived the abuse that her mother dished out, but that wasn’t the case for five-year-old Garnett Spears who was murdered by his mother Lacey Spears in 2014 after years of abuse and unnecessary medical procedures.

WebMD defines Munchausen by proxy as “a psychological disorder marked by attention-seeking behavior by a caregiver through those who are in their care.” Basically a caregiver, usually a parent, either makes up symptoms or induces the symptoms in order to get attention and sympathy.

Signs of Munchausen by proxy
A history of illnesses, injuries, or hospital visits.
Symptoms that don’t fit a disease or match any test results.
Symptoms that improve while at the hospital but worsen while the child is at home with the parent.

A pattern of lies

Before we get to the events of today’s post, we need to go back to Garnett’s mother Lacey Spears’ childhood.

Lacey was born in 1987 in Decatur, Alabama, which is part of why I’m interested in this case. I live not far from there. But Lacey did not have a good childhood.

Her father was mostly absent but when Lacey saw him, they would argue. And her mother was cold and completely unaffectionate toward Lacey. And if you know anything about childhood trauma and attachment disorders, you know this is a recipe for disaster.

Here we have a young girl who desperately wants love and attention from her parents, but she wasn’t getting it, so she had to replace the missing piece in her life with something else. And when she was a child it was dolls. I know. So creepy. Even creepier is the fact that Lacey basically treated the dolls as her children and was basically inseparable from them. She treated them like they were her own children.

This is a running theme throughout Lacey’s life. She so desperately wanted to be a mother, perhaps to compensate for the failure of her own mother. She even took to calling any adult woman in her life “mom.” Weird, I know.

By the time Lacey was in high school, she had stopped carrying the dolls with her, but that wasn’t enough to make her classmates like her. Lacey was unpopular because she had a pathological lying habit. We all know people like this. She would lie about things that didn’t matter and make up fantastical stories for attention.

When Lacey was 14, she told her friends that she was pregnant, but they didn’t believe her. And then when she showed up at school a few days later saying that she had an abortion, they didn’t believe that either.

I should note here that Lacey accused her parents of physical and sexual abuse, but no charges were ever brought against her parents despite the claims being reported to authorities. I’m not saying that she was or was not abused in that way. I try to always believe victims, but when a person lies as often and as easily as Lacey did, you have to wonder if these allegations were true or a ploy for attention.

Obsession with children
When Lacey finished school, she started working at a daycare in Decatur. There were parents there who were uncomfortable with Lacey’s attachment to their children, but she was never fired. Lacey eventually moved on to a private babysitting situation in addition to working at the daycare. She ensured that her entire day was filled with caring for children.

In 2006, Lacey began babysitting Christy Burnham’s son Camryn. Christy was a single mother with no car, so free babysitting was a godsend to her. But Lacey began keeping Camryn longer and longer every time she watched him. Christy basically had to beg Lacey to bring Camryn back.

And Camryn would always come back to Christy with an ear infection. Was Lacey responsible? Remember the ear infections because it comes up again.

Once at a park, a woman approached Christy and Camryn and referred to Camryn as Lacey’s baby. So she had been telling people at the park that Camryn was her own child.

In 2007, Lacey took Camryn for a weekend but didn’t return him on Sunday, like she and Christy had arranged. She turned up on Monday with Camryn. This was the last straw for Christy who stopped letting Lacey keep Camryn.

After Camryn, Lacey began to babysit Autumn Hunt’s son, Jonathon on weekends. She would post photos of Jonathon on MySpace with creepy captions like “A Mother’s Love Is Unexplainable.” Reminder, Jonathon is not her child. A friend saw these photos and told Autumn about them. Autumn confronted Lacey who tearfully apologized.

This photo was captioned "Me & JonJon"

Pregnancy
As an adult, Lacey progressed from watching other people’s children to having a child of her own. She began looking for a man to get her pregnant. I don’t think Lacey ever wanted a real relationship with any man. She just wanted to get pregnant.

She met a police officer named Blake, and she went on a few dates with him. They never had sex.

Then she started seeing a neighbor named Chris Hill. He said that all Lacey cared about was sex so that she would fall pregnant. And she did get pregnant. Chris wanted to get married and raise their child together, but Lacey claimed that Chris wasn’t the father. She would later assert that it was Blake, but that isn’t true. The baby was Chris’s.

Garnett Spears was born on December 3, 2008. What happened in the five years before Garnett’s death is so horrible that it is difficult to even imagine.

Garnett’s childhood
Garnett Spears
Garnett Spears
Lacey constantly posted photos of Garnett on MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter.

Two days after Garnett’s birth, Lacey brought him to the hospital saying that he had a fever and an ear infection, but the doctors couldn’t find anything wrong with him, so they were sent home. But then a few weeks later around Christmas of 2008, Lacey rushed Garnett to the hospital claiming that he wouldn’t eat anything and was vomiting. Doctors never saw any symptoms.

In 2009, Lacey took Garnett to a pediatrician almost every day. None of these doctors ever saw Garnett display any of the symptoms that Lacey described. Eventually, doctors would become suspicious about these phantom symptoms, and every time that happened, Lacey would just find a new doctor.

Somehow (and this blows my mind) Lacey convinced a doctor to perform surgery to install some kind of device to prevent him from vomiting. A drastic move especially considering this doctor had never seen the symptoms that Lacey claimed Garnett experienced. She also convinced a doctor to install a feeding tube. Again, no proof he needed it.

Lacey and Garnett Spears
Lacey and Garnett Spears
Plenty of family and friends saw Garnett eating normally, but one friend said that she saw Lacey punish Garnett for eating. Yikes.

During the first year of his life, Garnett had 23 hospital stays for vomiting, nausea, ear infections, and even perforated eardrums.

In 2012, Lacey moved to Florida to live with her grandmother probably because she had seen every doctor in her area and needed new people who didn’t know Garnett’s history.

It was during this time that Lacey started a blog to document Garnett’s illnesses and journey. The blog is still live if you want to check it out. She claimed on the blog that Garnett’s father was Blake, the man she had been on two dates with and never slept with. And it seems like this newfound attention online only served to escalate Lacey’s dangerous attention-seeking behavior.

Garnett and Lacey Spears
At the end of 2012, Lacey and Garnett who was four at the time moved to a commune in New York. I’ll be honest and say that I do not really understand this move. Sources say she wanted a better life, but I think maybe she had run out of doctors again.

By all accounts, Lacey and Garnett liked their new home. Garnett seemed happy and healthy. A doctor even suggested removing Garnett’s feeding tube. Lacey didn’t like this idea.

Garnett’s death
Garnett and Lacey Spears
Garnett Spears
Garnett and Lacey Spears
In January 2014, Lacey called a friend at the commune to ask for a ride to the hospital because Garnett was having a seizure. So this friend rushes over, but Lacey doesn’t really seem to be in a hurry. She noticed that a bag of milky white liquid was attached to Garnett’s feeding tube.

Once at the hospital, Lacey seemed more concerned with taking photos of Garnett than trying to help him. Doctors could tell that Garnett wanted to throw up but he couldn’t because of that surgery. I’m no medical expert, but isn’t vomiting an important thing to be able to do? Say you were poisoned for example. If you can’t vomit that up, you would die.

Garnett was at the hospital for a few days. All of Garnett’s levels were fine and doctors didn’t see any reason to keep him at the hospital any longer.

Before they were released, Garnett is seen on security tape laughing and looking fine. Then Lacey takes him to the bathroom, which is not on camera. When they return Garnett is visibly ill. I mean I can see how much he wants to vomit. It’s hard to watch honestly.

At this point, doctors ran blood work again, but now Garnett’s sodium level was 182, which is miles higher than when he was admitted and higher than the dangerous sodium level of 160. The sodium was causing his brain to swell, and by the time doctors got his levels back to a normal range 24 hours later, Garnett was brain-dead.

Then Lacey took hundreds of pictures of his dead body. Like, what?

Lacey called the friend who took them to the hospital and asked her to get rid of that bag of white liquid. This woman was no dummy though and she went right to the police with it. It was a high-sodium mixture. In addition to this damning physical evidence, Lacey had been googling the dangers of high sodium levels while Garnett was in the hospital.

Conviction

Lacey was arrested of course, but she pleaded not guilty. She was convicted of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Lacey gave a bonkers interview to 48 Hours. She basically says that all she wanted to do was establish a medical history for Garnett, which I’m not even sure what that means.

Final Thoughts
I find Munchausen by proxy so interesting. Seriously, if you haven’t read/watched Sharp Objects, you should go do it now.

Let me know what you think of this case in the comments and let me know if there are any cases you would like me to cover in the future.

TTYL,

Hey, y’all. Thanks for stopping by. Have you heard of cult leader Larry Ray? Maybe, maybe not. But you should learn about him.

I first came across this cult a year or so ago and immediately became obsessed with the case, which led me to the excellent article by Ezra Marcus and James Walsh in New York Magazine that really broke the case open.

Larry Ray physically and sexually assaulted the “Ray family,” inflicted emotional and mental torture, and committed financial crimes over the course of a decade.

The story of Larry Ray and the cult he created at Sarah Lawrence College is the stuff of nightmares. It’s a tale of manipulation, manipulation, and more manipulation. It’s also terrifyingly common. According to The New York Times, somewhere between 300,000 and three million people are in cults in America.

Larry Ray moves in
Cult Following: Larry Ray And The Sarah Lawrence Sex Cult
Slonim Woods 9
In the fall of 2010, Larry Ray (real name Lawrence Grecco) asked his 19-year-old daughter Talia Ray if he could crash at Talia’s dorm at Sarah Lawrence College, which is located in upstate New York.

So Talia ran this by her roommates (Isabella, Santos, Daniel, and Claudia) at their dorm Slonim 9 who were happy to let him stay. Larry slept on an air mattress in the living room. I would probably not be okay with this if I lived there.

At the time, Larry was 50 years old and had just been released from prison for investment fraud schemes. The way Talia told it, he was arrested for bringing the truth to light and exposing corruption in government.

I don’t know that much about financial crimes but according to sources, he paid $100,000 as a bribe and was convicted of security fraud.

I should note here that Larry was politically powerful. He rubbed elbows with Rudy Guiliani and former NYC police commissioner Bernard Kerik.

There’s a lot more information about these relationships in this New York Times article if you’re interested, but I’m going to stick to the events that occurred after Larry moved in with Talia and her roommates in 2010.

Cult Following: Larry Ray And The Sarah Lawrence Sex Cult
Talia and her father Larry
So Larry moved in and immediately began ingratiating himself with the 19-year-olds who lived there by cooking extravagant meals for them and ordering expensive takeout. If you’ve been to college, you know how enticing this could be. You get tired of ramen, you know?

In addition to the dinners, Larry started holding court in the dorm’s common area. He would lecture the college students about philosophy and the meaning of life.

And for the most part, they seemed to like it. They began viewing Larry as a father figure and someone to look up to.

Pretty quickly, those lectures and dinners were turning into twisted therapy sessions. He used all the high-control group techniques-sleep deprivation, violence, humiliation, threats, and then some.

If you listen to True Crime Obsessed (and you should), you’ll know what I mean when I say tick tock, cult o’clock.

It didn’t take long for Larry to start doing those weird manipulation things that cult leaders like to do. He told the kids that fate had brought him and the group together because they all had an obsession with suicide. And Larry began calling the group “The Ray Family.”

Cult Following: Larry Ray And The Sarah Lawrence Sex Cult
Talia and Isabella
By the first Christmas that Larry spent with the students in 2010, Larry had become particularly fond of Isabella who was struggling in her life. She turned to Larry for advice and he obliged. One way he helped Isabella was by sleeping in her room with her. On the floor. But still…

Isabella’s boyfriend at the time was not cool with this arrangement for obvious reasons.

Isabella didn’t return home for the 2010 Christmas break, instead opting to stay in an apartment that was owned by one of Larry’s friends. In case you were wondering, Larry was still sleeping in the same bedroom as Isabella.

During that school break, Larry told Isabella to stop taking her antipsychotic prescription and she did. Isabella’s boyfriend broke up with her when the break was over. Isabella became Larry’s defacto girlfriend.

Cult Following: Larry Ray And The Sarah Lawrence Sex Cult
Larry
At the end of the school year in 2011, Daniel who was a resident at Slonim 9 broke up with his girlfriend and he had nowhere to stay that summer.

By now, the students were no longer living in the dorm on campus but were basically squatting in the same apartment they had been to during Christmas break. So, Larry asked Daniel to move in, and he agreed.

Larry continued to buy the group expensive dinners and also clothing. Always with cash. That’s not fishy.

But when the group was in that apartment on 93rd street, Larry had total control of them. He would interrogate them one by one usually because they had done something that Larry didn’t like. Minor mistakes were deemed manifestations of childhood trauma. And I’m talking about spilling a glass of water.

During these sessions, he continued to gather intel about these kids. But he also offered answers, or at least what the roommates thought were answers.

But when the person being questioned didn’t weave a tale that fit into Larry’s twisted narrative, they would just fabricate stories to make the grilling stop.

They were up all hours of the night having these “therapy” sessions. Sleep deprivation is a great control technique. You’re too tired to fight and your judgment is clouded.

Not only did Larry blame small mistakes on childhood trauma, but he also said that those mistakes were intentional by the students to harm him. And anytime someone committed a mistake, Larry forced them to sign written confessions. These were completely fabricated.

The group would confess to damaging Larry’s property and assaulting him personally. And he gathered hundreds of these confessions. They were all written in almost the exact same language.

Daniel
Cult Following: Larry Ray And The Sarah Lawrence Sex Cult
Daniel
During his time at the 93rd Street apartment, Daniel really was put through it. Daniel had questions about his sexuality, but Larry very adamantly said there was no way that Daniel was gay. Not sure how he could know that or why it even matters.

For some reason, Larry was very interested in Daniel’s sexuality. He convinced Isabella to kiss Daniel before moving into the bedroom. Larry told them to have sex and he watched. This happened many times, with Larry participating sometimes. I guess he wanted to prove to Daniel that he wasn’t gay, which is bisexual erasure if I’ve ever heard it.

Claudia and Daniel both left the apartment in the summer of 2011 for a study abroad program in England, but that didn’t stop Larry from controlling them. They would have Skype meetings and he talked them through having sex together.

During the 2012-2013 school term Daniel’s abuse escalated into real physical abuse. Daniel was forced to wrap a string of aluminum foil balls around his genitals while Larry tightened and twisted it.

And yet, Daniel stayed with the group until 2013. That’s the power Larry had.

Santos
Cult Following: Larry Ray And The Sarah Lawrence Sex Cult
Talia and Santos
Daniel wasn’t Larry’s only physical target. He would also choke Santos until he passed out.

Another one of Larry’s favorite things to do was claim that the roommates had damaged or stolen his items. In fact, Santos wrote an itemized list of things that he had supposedly ruined or stolen. That list totaled more than $47,000.00.

How was Santos going to get the money to pay Larry? He turned to his parents and threatened to unalive himself if they didn’t give him the money. His parents went to the apartment to see the damage themselves, but Larry blocked them from entering. They gave Santos as much money as they could.

Yalitza, Felicia, and Santos
While Daniel was trying to escape Larry’s grasp, Larry had new victims to play with. Santos introduced Larry to his older sisters Yalitza and Felicia in 2011.

The sisters were both bright and well-educated. Yalitza was attending Columbia when she first visited the apartment on 93rd Street. Felicia was a Harvard grad with a medical degree. She was completing her residency in Los Angeles when she was introduced to Larry. They began having regular phone calls.

Larry convinced Felicia that people were after her. I’m not sure how he did that exactly, but I assume the same way he manipulated the roommates. This belief that she was in danger led Felicia to quit her residency. Let that sink in. He convinced someone who had completed medical school to drop out and move in with him across the country in New York.

Yalitza attempted suicide in 2013 by taking a whole bottle of Tylenol. Larry wouldn’t let her parents into her hospital room without him being present while she was in a coma.

Claudia
Claudia also attempted suicide via Tylenol in 2014. And Larry didn’t let her parents see Claudia alone either. Claudia wouldn’t even talk to her parents.

He recorded Claudia confessing to poisoning himself, Talia, Felicia, and Isabella with mercury and arsenic. Larry would upload these confessions to his website, along with other video journal entries.

Cult Following: Larry Ray And The Sarah Lawrence Sex Cult
Claudia
Claudia told a family friend about the videos and Larry was furious when he found out she had told. As punishment, Larry ordered Claudia to strip before tying her to a chair. He suffocated her with a plastic bag multiple times until she passed out. He also put her next to a freezing air conditioner and poured cold water over her.

Larry’s favorite/possible girlfriend Isabella helped with this torture. Isabella basically gaslit Claudia during the assault by telling her that the freezing water being poured on her was actually room temperature.

The pair even took a break to go get takeout while Claudia was still tied up.

Pinehurst, North Carolina
During their senior year, Larry took Claudia, Isabella, Yalitza, and Felicia to his father’s home in North Carolina. He brought them there so that they could install a new drainage system on the property. And like, what? Your guess on this is as good as mine.

These women were operating heavy machineries like backhoes with no training or experience. And then he began to claim that they had intentionally damaged the property. Santos, Yalitza, and Felicia’s parents gave Larry over $200,000 over a three-year period for these “damages.” They even had to sell their home.

In order to pay for the damage, Claudia began working as an escort. She offered services for $8,000.00 per night. Isabella tracked the money that Claudia was bringing in.

The total amount of money that Larry took from the students totaled somewhere around $1 million, and half of that came from Claudia though some sources say that Claudia handed over around $2.5 million.

Arrest/Trial/Sentence
Larry
Cult Following: Larry Ray And The Sarah Lawrence Sex Cult
The article that ran in New York Magazine led to an investigation into Larry and his eventual arrest in 2020. Don’t forget that he moved into the dorm in 2010, so this is a decade of abuse.

He faced nine charges including sex trafficking, extortion, and forced labor.

Larry was convicted on all counts but his sentencing hearing is scheduled for December 1, 2022. I will be keeping an eye out for his sentence.

Isabella
Isabella was both a victim and a victimizer. I think about that conundrum often. At what point does someone who has been manipulated and brainwashed become responsible for his or her actions?

The state of New York believed that Isabella was at least partially responsible for the crimes committed by her father. They called her Larry’s “top lieutenant.”

There’s no denying that Isabella did some bad things for Larry, including overseeing Claudia’s sex work. And in 2022 Isabella was charged with money laundering as well.

She took a plea deal to avoid trial and has also not yet been sentenced.

Final thoughts
Whew. I hope this was a somewhat coherent telling of this story, but it really is sprawling. There is so much more to the story and I highly recommend the New York Magazine article.

This cult is another prime example of very smart people falling for charismatic leaders. So be careful when you think that it can’t happen to you because that’s exactly when it does.

Oh, and Daniel wrote a memoir about his experience, Slonim Woods 9: A Memoir.

Let me know your thoughts in the comments below and let me know if there are any other cases you would like me to cover!

TTYL

On December 18, 1997, Amber Barker was only ten years old and a fourth grader in Oklahoma City.

On that fateful day, Amber excitedly hopped on her blue 10-speed bicycle around 3 p.m., eager to visit her friend who lived only half a mile away from her home. Amber took her blue 10-speed bicycle around 3 p.m.

Upon arriving at her friend’s house, Amber made sure to call her mom, Bonnie, to check in. As they chatted, Amber shared her worries about getting in trouble for staying out too late. Like any loving and understanding mother, Bonnie reassured her that she wouldn’t be in any trouble at all.

Amber hung out with her friend until 5:50 p.m. before heading back home for the five-minute bike ride.

This is where things take a gut-wrenching turn. By 7:20 p.m., Amber hadn’t made it home, and her mother’s concern started to grow. Bonnie couldn’t shake the nagging worry and decided to ride up and down the route Amber should have taken, desperately searching for any sign of her precious daughter.

But there was no trace of Amber, and Bonnie’s heart sank. Realizing that something was terribly wrong, she called the police.

The search
The local police, the FBI, family members, neighbors, and even complete strangers all banded together to scour the streets for any sign of Amber.

The next morning, a chilling discovery was made: Amber’s bike was found abandoned in Denniston Park. I remember thinking how strange it was, given that the park isn’t even on the route Amber should have taken to get home, which is odd given that the park isn’t even on the route Amber should have taken to get home.

I’m secretly a talented artist
The most disturbing discoveries, though, were the details surrounding the condition of Amber’s belongings. Her shoe was found with traces of her blood on it, and her sweater bore vomit stains and mysterious blue fibers.

Person of interest
Daniel Smith
Disappearance of Amber Barker
The only picture of Daniel Smith I could find that was obviously taken on a potato.
The investigation into Amber’s disappearance seemed to focus primarily on one key suspect: Daniel John Smith. He was the boyfriend of Amber’s 22-year-old sister, Debbie Barker. Although the couple had a child together, they were estranged at the time of Amber’s disappearance.

Amber had previously told her mother that she was afraid of Daniel. She said that she was scared that he would kidnap her.

I tried to find out more about this, but unfortunately, that’s all the information I could find. Reading between the lines, though, it seems that Daniel might have made some unsettling comments or displayed concerning behavior that had Amber worried.

What’s more, it turns out that Smith had been at Amber’s house on the night she disappeared. He would have been there when Amber made that fateful phone call to her mother, alerting him that she was about to ride home, which seems to imply that Daniel could have been involved in her disappearance.

As I continued to look for more information, I couldn’t help but feel an overwhelming sense of frustration at the lack of concrete answers. The pieces of the puzzle just didn’t seem to fit together quite right, leaving me with a gnawing unease that I couldn’t shake.

And the direction Daniel took when he left Bonnie’s house shortly after that call would put him right in Amber’s path home. It’s one of those eerie details that just sticks with you and makes you wonder.

To add to the growing pile of circumstantial evidence against Daniel, it turns out he was actually furious with Amber’s sister Debbie on the very day Amber disappeared. According to newspaper reports from that time, Daniel was angry because Debbie had taken their child out of state. This made me wonder if there was more to Daniel’s involvement than just a chance encounter with Amber.

And let’s not forget about those mysterious blue fibers found on Amber’s sweater. As it turns out, the interior of Daniel’s truck just happened to be—you guessed it—blue. With each piece of the puzzle coming together, I couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that Daniel might have kidnapped Amber as a twisted form of retaliation against her sister Debbie. The connections were too strong to ignore.

Daniel’s criminal history
disappearance of amber barker
Daniel was no stranger to trouble, and it seemed like he had a knack for finding himself in the thick of it. Back in 1995, he was convicted of kidnapping a woman from a nightclub. If you ask him, he’ll tell you it was all a drunken mistake; he was just trying to steal her car. But the fact remained that she was in the car and he wouldn’t let her out. Initially charged with robbery, the charge was later changed to kidnapping.

And then he was also charged with witness intimidation after he threatened a security guard at a hearing.

As if that wasn’t enough, Daniel found himself facing another charge: witness intimidation. This came about after he threatened a security guard during a hearing for the kidnapping charge. 

In 1997, things took an even darker turn when Daniel allegedly assaulted Debbie, Amber’s sister. Debbie claimed that he hit her when she refused to have sex with him. Daniel had a court date scheduled for this crime in January 1998, the very month following Amber’s disappearance.

At the time of Amber’s abduction in 1998, Daniel was on parole for the kidnapping charge. As part of his parole conditions, he was required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Unfortunately, his knack for finding trouble reared its head again when he missed a meeting right before Amber went missing. The police swiftly issued a warrant for his arrest.

The suicide that made the case go cold
The authorities had their sights set on Daniel as a person of interest in Amber’s disappearance, and for good reason. They planned to arrest and interview him, hoping to shed light on what happened to Amber. However, that crucial interview never took place.

On December 22, just four days after Amber vanished, Daniel was found dead in Del City’s Ray Trent Park. In a tragic twist, he had taken his own life by hanging himself from a tree. His death was ultimately ruled a suicide.

With Daniel’s passing, any hope of finding answers in Amber’s case seemed to slip away. Amber was never found, neither dead nor alive, and with the primary suspect now gone, it appears unlikely that the police or Amber’s family will ever uncover the truth.

But it’s now November 2022 as of this writing and I have to think that Amber is most likely dead.

Recent leads
In 2015, a curious twist emerged in the investigation. Authorities filed a search warrant, requesting DNA samples from an inmate named Forrest Jay Rice, who, for some reason, also went by Steven Brent Henley. I’m not entirely sure why he had two names, but that’s what the sources reported.

Forrest Jay Rice
disappearance of amber barker
Forrest Jay Rice
The police were eager to compare Forrest’s DNA with the samples found in the blood and vomit discovered on Amber’s belongings. It was a potentially crucial lead that could have unraveled the entire mystery.

Now, here’s where things get even more intriguing. Forrest claimed that he had seen Daniel at his apartment on the night of Amber’s disappearance. He also said that he was with Daniel on the day he took his own life. This connection between Forrest and Daniel made the situation all the more puzzling and raised questions about Forrest’s possible involvement.

I spent hours scouring the internet, trying to find any information on whether Forrest’s DNA was a match or if the samples had even been compared at all. But I ended up empty-handed. It’s frustrating not to know whether this potentially crucial piece of evidence was ever fully explored or if it led anywhere in the investigation.

So, there you have it, my friends. Another layer of complexity in this already baffling case, and yet another question that remains unanswered. As much as I would love to provide some closure, the truth is that we’re still left wondering what really happened to Amber and if this perplexing lead with Forrest Jay Rice (or Steven Brent Henley, if you prefer) was ever truly followed up on.

What do I think?
I can’t help but think that Daniel Smith might have been behind Amber’s disappearance, possibly as a form of revenge for Debbie taking their child out-of-state without his consent. I mean, it seems like a plausible explanation, doesn’t it?

However, there’s one puzzle piece that doesn’t quite fit: Forrest. How on earth does he tie into all of this? Was he somehow involved in the crime, or did he simply know more than he was willing to admit? I’m genuinely stumped here, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on the matter.
